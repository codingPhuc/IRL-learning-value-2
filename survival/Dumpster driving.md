- legal  in all  50 state 
- main catch is  decided  on your county  law 
- you shouldn't  hop over fiend and  wall  or if there is a sign showing no dumpster driving 
main sign  : 
1. Federal law: Legal
2. State law: Legal
3. County law: It depends, and you must research this
4. City law: It depends, and you must research this
5. A restaurant or business's specific rules: It depends, and you must research this
6. Private property: Illegal
7. Warning signs or locks on the dumpster: Illegal

If you jump a fence, walk through a gate, or in any way walk onto private property to dumpster dive, then you may beÂ [trespassing](https://www.findlaw.com/realestate/land-use-laws/trespassing-basics.html). Many stores have back areas that are still considered private property. The exception would be any stores that have their trash on a public city street.
Private property would make any dumpster diving illegal without the permission of the owner of the company or building, and you could get a ticket or be arrested.
