###  Cleaning the whole car

The video demonstrates how to "super clean" a car's interior, which goes beyond a normal clean like just vacuuming and dusting. The goal is to make the interior look "brand spanking new" using **readily available and inexpensive tools and products**. Cleaning the interior is considered the most important part of the car to clean because it's where you spend all your time. The cleaning process is shown on two example cars: a heavily vandalized car with intentional dirt and melted candy, and a typical daily driver car with common dirt like oils on door panels and dust.

The steps covered in this segment are cleaning the carpets, then the floor mats, followed by the trunk, and finally the headliner.

Before starting, you need to **prepare the car**. This involves **rolling down the windows** to avoid getting cleaners on them. You also **pop the trunk open**. Critically, you should **unscrew and disconnect the negative battery cable**. Disconnecting the battery is important for two reasons: it prevents the battery from draining while doors are open for potentially hours, and it's necessary for safety when removing seats that may have airbags. If seats have airbags, the battery should be disconnected for 20 minutes before removal.

The next preparation step is **removing the seats**. The front seats are removed by sliding them forward to access front screws, then pushing them back to access rear screws. Any electrical harnesses need to be disconnected. Care must be taken not to scratch interior parts with the metal seat parts. Rear seats are typically removed by pressing levers below the seat sides. Removing the seats is considered crucial because it allows access to **clean underneath them**, which is where a lot of junk and dirt accumulate and can hold onto odors. Cleaning under the seats is important for a "super clean" interior. After removing the seats, **all loose junk, garbage, and papers** should be removed from the interior and the trunk. Removing all this junk is described as "half the battle".

Once prepared, the video details how to **clean the carpets**:

- **Basic items needed** include microfiber towels, a good vacuum (like a powerful wet-dry shop vac), a stiff bristle brush, and carpet cleaner. Optional items for a deeper clean include a steamer, a water injection carpet vacuum (extractor), and a drill brush attachment.



- **Step 1: Vacuuming** Remove floor mats first, folding edges to prevent dirt from falling back onto the carpet. Vacuum surface dirt and debris.
- **Step 2: Brushing and Vacuuming Deep Dirt** Use a brush to agitate the carpet fibers and loosen dirt embedded deep within them. Immediately vacuum up the dirt brought to the surface by the brush. Brushing is a "huge help" in getting out deep dirt.
- **Step 3: Spot Treatment** Address any stains that didn't come out with vacuuming and brushing, such as melted chocolate or gum.
    - A simple technique is using **hot soapy water** (around 120°F) with a toothbrush or brush. Remove large pieces of the stain, saturate the area with soapy water, agitate with a brush, and blot up with a towel.
    - Another method uses a **steam cleaner** (around 212°F). Steam alone can loosen stains like gum without soap. Use the steam pressure and heat, then remove the stain. Steam can also sanitize the area, preventing mold and odors.
- **Step 4: Shampooing** This step removes odors, small stains, discoloration, and dirt not captured by vacuuming.
    - Spray the entire carpet with carpet cleaner, preferably one that also removes odors.
    - Use a brush to agitate the cleaner deep into the fibers, brushing in different directions for even coverage.
    - Use an absorbent microfiber towel with medium pressure, rubbing back and forth to absorb dirt and cleaner.
    - Vacuum up any remaining loose dirt and cleaner. Drawing lines in the carpet while vacuuming helps ensure thoroughness.
    - Make a final pass with a towel to absorb any last bits of dirt and cleaner.
    - For an even cleaner result, a **water injection carpet vacuum (extractor)** is highly suggested. This machine injects water/cleaner into the carpet and immediately sucks it back out, removing dirt and leaving the carpet damp but not soaked.
    - After cleaning, use a clean stiff brush to **brush all the carpet fibers in one direction**. This makes the carpet look even and consistent in shade and color.
- **Important Caution:** Do **not oversaturate** the carpets with liquid. The sound deadening material underneath the carpet acts like a sponge, holds water, is hard to dry, and can lead to mold. Use just the carpet cleaner or an extractor.

Based on the provided sources, the video "HOW TO CLEAN RUBBER FLOOR MATS !! QUICK & EASY !" by Pan The Organizer focuses on providing **pro tips on how to clean rubber floor mats**. The goal is to transform a very dirty mat that has been exposed to conditions like crazy Canadian winters into a **very clean and brand-new looking floor mat** using simple steps, products, and tools.

The technique discussed in the video applies to both **rubber mats and plastic mats**. The example shown is a dirty floor mat caked with road salt, mud, dirt, debris, dust, and other contaminants from Canadian winters.

The recommended **products and tools** for this cleaning process are:

- A **pressure washer or a garden hose**.
- A **brush** of your choice (bigger or smaller).
- A **cleaner** of your choice. The presenter likes to use **Super Clean diluted one in three or one in four with water** to create a solution. Other classic options mentioned include McGuire's Super Degreaser or McGuire's All-Purpose Cleaner.
- A **microfiber towel** to blot dry or a **car dryer** to push hot, filtered air into the nooks and crannies. The specific car dryer mentioned is the **Metro Vac Blaster Sidekick**.
- As an **optional finishing touch**, **Stoner Trim Shine** is used to give an OEM matte look that is non-greasy for safety.

The main **steps** outlined in the video are:

1. **Rinse the mat**. (Step number one is to go ahead and rinse the mat).
2. Apply and work in the chosen cleaner using a brush (implied by the mention of brush and cleaner use after rinsing).
3. **Rinse off** the cleaner.
4. **Dry the mat** using a microfiber towel or car dryer.
5. (Optional) Apply a finishing product like Stoner Trim Shine.

The video demonstrates going from a dirty floor mat to one that **looks like it's brand new again**. The results are highlighted as speaking for themselves, showing an amazing brand new looking floor mat achieved from a very dirty starting point. The presenter reminds viewers that links to all products and tools used are included in the video description.


Cleaning the **trunk** is the next step.

- Remove the trunk floor and the spare tire to access all carpeted areas.
- Vacuum the carpeting in the spare tire well and the main trunk carpet. Use a brush if needed to loosen dirt.
- Clean and protect the **plastic trim** by spraying interior cleaner onto a brush, working it into the plastic (especially on textured surfaces), wiping it off with a microfiber towel, then applying a protectant the same way, and finally buffing it off. This makes the plastic look "brand new".
- Vacuum the main trunk carpet that was removed.
- Go beyond the interior carpet and clean the **painted surfaces around the trunk opening**, including the rain gutters, which can collect leaves and debris.
- Instead of hosing, use a **waterless wash** for painted surfaces to clean light dirt and prevent scratching. For tight spaces, use a soft brush to agitate dirt before wiping. Cleaning these "little details" like the painted surfaces and rain channels makes a big difference and gives the car a "brand new car Vibe" when the trunk is opened.

The final cleaning step in this segment is the **headliner**. Headliners are described as "delicate" and require a different approach than aggressive carpet cleaning to avoid damaging the material, foam, or adhesive, which could cause sagging.

- **Tools needed** are carpet cleaner, a soft bristle brush, and a soft absorbent microfiber towel. The brush and towel must be clean.
- The **technique is crucial** and focuses on using **as little liquid as possible**.
- Always try to **start with dry cleaning**: first, lightly rub the stain with a clean, dry microfiber towel. If the stain remains, use a clean, dry soft brush and lightly brush the area. Many marks can be removed this way without any liquids.
- If a stain requires liquid cleaner, the goal is **not to saturate the headliner**. Apply a small amount of carpet cleaner onto the microfiber towel or the brush first, then lightly wipe or brush the stain on the headliner.
- If a **watermark** occurs, you need to **feather it out**. While the area is still damp, use a clean towel or brush to blend the edge of the damp area outwards into the dry headliner, like feathering paint. Then, lightly wipe up moisture with a dry towel. This prevents a hard watermark line from appearing when it dries.

After cleaning the carpets, floor mats, trunk, and headliner, the interior starts to look "brand spanking new". The carpets look and smell much better, and distracting stains on the headliner are gone. The video indicates that cleaning the dashboard, center console, door panels, and seats will be covered in a future video.
