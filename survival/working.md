A lot of those crews strictly only hire people of their own kind that speak thier language. So unless you speak the language, you will run into issues.

That said, there are chicken and beef plants and such that have had a lot of trouble keeping people because of the cracking down on I-9 compliance that can't use illegals anymore.

However, these places are located in small towns no one wants to live. Really isolated, rural areas far, far away from any real town and quite a few plagued with rural slumlords. Think prepaid power, shitty apartment type rent to share a broken down trailer with 4 to 5 others, etc. Some so isolated even Greyhound might not go out there and you'd have to pay rural cab companies to go there. It is also dangerous, monotonous, long hour, low paid, grueling, nasty work.

Look on Indeed.

Some of them are so short, they have disturbingly been using child labor! In the early days of my homeless stint, they were even hitting shelters and busing people out 50 miles.


Try googling "day labor centers" in your area. Some cities or NGOs set up areas where people can go to get temp jobs. (Plano, TX has one.) In other cities, there are unofficial places where people gather to see if they can pick up work for the day. You have to ask around to find those places. Try asking workers at construction sites or who are picking up orders at Lowes or Home Depots.

They usually work construction or landscaping. Trust me those companies donnot care about felonies. They don't even check. You can be working tomorrow



No, I do not have a work permit, but there are plenty of avenues to finding work as undocumented. You all know the most common, but did you know that undocumented immigrants can be employed as independent contractors? And yes, we would have to file taxes using form 1099.

There are few states that allow undocumented immigrants to be certified by their state's bar. Luckily, Illinois is one of them. This means that, contingent on passing the Bar Exam, I can obtain my license to practice law.

"What do you think needs to be done at a policy level for undocumented immigrants who were brought here as children?" -- This question is a bit complicated. Normally, I would encourage congress to pass legislation that would give us a pathway to citizenship contingent on merit (i.e. The Dream Act). Unfortunately, this doesn't seem possible in our current political climate. This is why we push so hard for the executive branch to use their power to grant us relief. The problem is that this is often contested in federal court by conservative judges.

The programs that you're suggesting are all great ideas to me! Most of us have the skills and education necessary to be productive members of society, but we are very limited by our status. Many programs have been proposed, but creating one which republicans support is the bigger challenge.
