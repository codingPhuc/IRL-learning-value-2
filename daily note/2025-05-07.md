### 🎓 **Student Government at GWC**

Student Government is a group of students working directly with the college to enhance campus life and represent the student body.

#### Key Committees:

- **Campus Life Committee**  
    Organizes programs and life events (e.g., social events, snacks, student engagement).
    
- **Publicity Committee**  
    Focuses on communication and marketing—promotes events and keeps students informed.
    
- **Student Advocacy Committee**  
    Advocates for student rights and well-being, similar to a student judiciary. Helps plan activities and improve student experience.
