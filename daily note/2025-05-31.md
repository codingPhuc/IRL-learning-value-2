Do not think ahead of anything 

When washing your cup wash it by using your hand to wash the top of the cup radious 


Do not create an outbrust when ever someone critizie you 
 Do not sleep all the time you should go out and listen to other people when they are talking 


When you take gas from the gas station there is one call arco, there you can go to the casher and ask for a 10 buck refill then you can drive to cosco 

You need to organize your money better 
You still don't know how to estimate when a red light appear causing you to stop suddently, you should have run thought that yellow light instead of stopping 
You still don't know how to catch up to a car there is still space between you and another car

Why didn't ask for how much the drink cost, you wasted 6$

You need to run 2-3 time a morning 
When you unwarp candy, you need to rip it from the top
