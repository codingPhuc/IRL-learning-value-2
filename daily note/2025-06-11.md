How  to know 
Every living thing have carbon animal 

Carbon 14 is unstable 
Half carbon 14 is decay into nitrochen
Carbon 12 is more stable 

# Isotopes and  carbon dating 


Tou take the mass bu it abondunt multiply 12 by 0.989  add it togethor then you will have 11.8
## Chemical bonds 
Thr electron of 1 atom connect with other atom form bound 
The bound closes to the nucleous 
Will have only 2 element 
pic 2 
You can count the number of shell from top to bottem, you can used this methodcto count the number of electron as well 


When an atom gain or loss electon it become charge gain something it become negative 
Loss electron positive charge 
Positively chare ion 

## Type of bound
Strong bond 
Iconic bond 
Covalrnt bond 
Kames bond 
### Week bond 
Hrydoden 
Pull the electon alway from hrydogen 
Water does this 
Van der waals 
Negative atom push always the negative charge in the negative atom 

## Ionic bonds
The atom donating the electron become positive 
The atom receving the electon become negative 

## Covalent bond 
Shared elec  without giving them  go around both stom 

## Non cova 
Are not share evently 
Must more likely to be at
