How  to know 
Every living thing have carbon animal 

Carbon 14 is unstable 
Half carbon 14 is decay into nitrochen
Carbon 12 is more stable 

# Isotopes and  carbon dating 


Tou take the mass bu it abondunt multiply 12 by 0.989  add it togethor then you will have 11.8
## Chemical bonds 
Thr electron of 1 atom connect with other atom form bound 
The bound closes to the nucleous 
Will have only 2 element

You can count the number of shell from top to bottem, you can used this methodcto count the number of electron as well 


When an atom gain or loss electon it become charge gain something it become negative 
Loss electron positive charge 
Positively chare ion
