How  to know 
Every living thing have carbon animal 

Carbon 14 is unstable 
Half carbon 14 is decay into nitrochen
Carbon 12 is more stable 

# Isotopes and  carbon dating 


Tou take the mass bu it abondunt multiply 12 by 0.989  add it togethor then you will have 11.8
## Chemical bonds 
Thr electron of 1 atom connect with other atom form bound 
The bound closes to the nucleous 
Will have only 2 element 
pic 2 
You can count the number of shell from top to bottem, you can used this methodcto count the number of electron as well 


When an atom gain or loss electon it become charge gain something it become negative 
Loss electron positive charge 
Positively chare ion 

## Type of bound
Strong bond 
Iconic bond 
Covalrnt bond 
Kames bond 
### Week bond 
Hrydoden 
Pull the electon alway from hrydogen 
Water does this 
Van der waals 
Negative atom push always the negative charge in the negative atom 

## Ionic bonds
The atom donating the electron become positive 
The atom receving the electon become negative 

## Covalent bond 
Shared elec  without giving them  go around both stom 

## Non cova 
Are not share evently 
Must more likely to be at

The lower cases delta is too show the negativity 


## Hydrogen bond
Hydrogrn bond form between slightly positiv and slightly negative 
Ethonol anf water work similarly polar covalent bond 

# Van de war 
If you have two atom if  one atom is really negative it push all the negative to one side 
Creating one side negatice one side  positive 

What type pf chemical bond 
Heydogen bond kind of a bond 

Between water tou have hy


## waterf is polar 
Very good at disoving polar thing
 Rhing that does not disolve in water 
 Define by hydro, hydro pilet like water 
 Suger like water stick to sugar very hydro Water on bread help keep the water i  the bread used sugar 
Water is excellent solvent 

Water stablize temperature 
Moluces movkgn around 
How solid have much vibrating gas liquid atom are moving around 
Ice is a solid is move less than water less than gas 
It take a lot of engry to take hydrogen and turn it into gas 
Evaporation
Enegy of that enegry  

## Water is less dense than solid
In ice have too be lock to minimize positive to positive negative to negative 

Water is cohezive anx adhisive 
Cohesion something to stick to it self 
Adhisition is watef stick to something else 
Magnit and a neddle put it into a glass of water point to south 
## Water can have a range of ph value
How many three hydrogen ion on something ph above 7 the oposite of hydrogen 
Phd above 7 it is basic  
If you chang
