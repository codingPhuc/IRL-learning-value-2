How  to know 
Every living thing have carbon animal 

Carbon 14 is unstable 
Half carbon 14 is decay into nitrochen
Carbon 12 is more stable 

# Isotopes and  carbon dating 


Tou take the mass bu it abondunt multiply 12 by 0.989  add it togethor then you will have 11.8
## Chemical bonds 
Thr electron of 1 atom connect with other atom form bound 
The bound closes to the nucleous 
Will have only 2 element 
pic 2 
You can count the number of shell from top to bottem, you can used this methodcto count the number of electron as well 


When an atom gain or loss electon it become charge gain something it become negative 
Loss electron positive charge 
Positively chare ion 

## Type of bound
Strong bond 
Iconic bond 
Covalrnt bond 
Kames bond 
### Week bond 
Hrydoden 
Pull the electon alway from hrydogen 
Water does this 
Van der waals 
Negative atom push always the negative charge in the negative atom 

## Ionic bonds
The atom donating the electron become positive 
The atom receving the electon become negative 

## Covalent bond 
Shared elec  without giving them  go around both stom 

## Non cova 
Are not share evently 
Must more likely to be at

The lower cases delta is too show the negativity 


## Hydrogen bond
Hydrogrn bond form between slightly positiv and slightly negative 
Ethonol anf water work similarly polar covalent bond 

# Van de war 
If you have two atom if  one atom is really negative it push all the negative to one side 
Creating one side negatice one side  positive 

What type pf chemical bond 
Heydogen bond kind of a bond 

Between water tou have hy


## waterf is polar 
Very good at disoving polar thing
 Rhing that does not disolve in water 
 Define by hydro, hydro pilet like water 
 Suger like water stick to sugar very hydro Water on bread help keep the water i  the bread used sugar 
Water is excellent solvent 

Water stablize temperature 
Moluces movkgn around 
How solid have much vibrating gas liquid atom are moving around 
Ice is a solid is move less than water less than gas 
It take a lot of engry to take hydrogen and turn it into gas 
Evaporation
Enegy of that enegry  

## Water is less dense than solid
In ice have too be lock to minimize positive to positive negative to negative 

Water is cohezive anx adhisive 
Cohesion something to stick to it self 
Adhisition is watef stick to something else 
Magnit and a neddle put it into a glass of water point to south 
## Water can have a range of ph value
How many three hydrogen ion on something ph above 7 the oposite of hydrogen 
Phd above 7 it is basic  
If you change ph you can break down the protein 
If you put milk in your tea and lemon in it decrease the ph when you put lemon with milk 
Your stomas is very low ph help break down the food 
Blood is close to neutral 

Buffer soemthing that help keep the ph the same keep that ph if it high or low keep it about he same resif change in ph 

## Why should you care 

Blood neex >7.4  phd if high or low you get diesea

Csrbonate in your blood keep your blood to become high and low 
Hypleventalate you get dissy 
Carbon dioxy shortness of breath organ fail and you die 
Your body does not care about oxygen in your blood more carbon dioxy is more hurtful for your blood 
If you beath nitrogen you dont input oxygen beath out carbkn dyoxy 


##### Atom of living thig 
HONk is how you remember living thing 
Organic molicure all have to do with carbon and it ability to make this for box 


Carbon have one electron share wih that oxygen one share with the othe 

Carbon have 4 empty space, 

## Classes of bilogical molecules
Carbohydrates 
Monosaccharide single su unit of a carbo hydrate 
Glucos is a monosaccaharide 
Polysaccharides is very important  any kinc for long enegry storage 
Both starches  and hydrogen is 
Cellulose strutural modicule that make up most plant 
Lipis 
Your fat they can be saturated or unsaturated 
Unstaturated is better less dense 
Steriod is a libid 
Protein is very important what your dna code for 

Enzyme are also protein 
What is a monomers ? They are sub unit that can bond to make polymer 
Molecule have a diverse set of carbon hrydogen bond is 
Disaccharise 
Polysaccharides used for storage 
Liver is a third thd size it is
