## Why it is good to go
- What you are wasting: 4 years of not earning any income + (5-7 years of PhD or 2 years of Master's)
1. If you work in Vietnam in the first 2 years:
	- Freshman salary: $300 - $700 per month
	- In two years, earning $700 minus 15% taxes equals $14,280 (not including living expenses)
	- Danger of military enforcement: Either pay $1,000 or go and waste two years, then you will have $12,000
2. If you work for the next 9 years:
	- Income: $1,800 per month
	- In the next 9 years, you will earn $145,000
	- You will work for the next 2 years: $32,400
- To sum it up: You will have about $190,000 in 11 years of work in the best-case scenario in Vietnam (not including living expenses) age  33  
- If you go to America and earn a PhD: age 33
	- You might be able to stay and earn $5,800 per month
	- After taxes, that will be $4,350 per month
	- $104,400 after two years of working at a wage for 50% of Americans
	- If you work 1 more year, you will break even with an income of $52,200
