# Free way driving 

Here's information regarding freeway driving, based on the provided sources:

**General Freeway Information and Rules:**

- **Speed Limit:** The **ideal maximum speed limit on most California highways is 65 mph**, unless otherwise posted.
- **Parking:** It is **illegal to park or leave your vehicle on a freeway**, except in an emergency, when a law enforcement officer requires a stop, or where a stop is specifically permitted. A vehicle stopped, parked, or left standing on a freeway for more than four hours may be removed. If you must stop, park completely off the pavement and stay in your vehicle with doors locked until help arrives.
- **Law Enforcement Stops:** If stopped by law enforcement on a freeway, **move completely onto the right shoulder**, even if you are in a carpool/HOV lane.
- **Double Fine Zones:** Fines are doubled in "Safety Enhanced-Double Fine Zones" and in highway construction or maintenance zones when workers are present.

**Lanes and Lane Usage on Freeways:**

- **Lane Numbering:** Traffic lanes are often numbered, with the **left (or fast) lane called the Number 1 Lane**, and subsequent lanes to the right numbered sequentially (Number 2 Lane, Number 3 Lane, etc.).
- **Passing Lanes:** On multilane roads, the **far-left lane is the passing lane**, used to pass other vehicles.
- **Trucks and Trailers:** When towing a vehicle or trailer, or driving a truck with three or more axles, you **must drive in the far-right lane or a lane marked for slower vehicles**. If no lanes are marked and there are four or more lanes in your direction, you may only drive in the two lanes closest to the right edge of the road.
- **Heavy Traffic/Bad Weather:** In heavy traffic or bad weather, you must drive slower. If another driver wishes to drive faster and is behind you, move to the right. If you choose to drive slower than other traffic, drive in the right lane.
- **Changing Lanes:**
    - Before changing lanes, **signal, check your mirrors, check traffic behind and beside you, and look over your shoulder** in the direction you plan to move to ensure the lane is clear.
    - Check your blind spots for other vehicles, motorcyclists, and bicyclists.
    - Ensure there is enough space for your vehicle.
    - It is not necessary to slow down before a lane change.
    - **Stay in one lane as much as possible** and avoid weaving in and out of traffic, as last-minute lane changes increase collision risk.
- **Ending Lanes:** Ending freeway lanes are usually marked with **large broken lines**. If you are in such a lane, be prepared to exit or for the lane to end; look for a sign indicating to exit or merge.
- **Double Solid White Lines:** These indicate a lane barrier between regular and preferential use lanes (like carpool lanes) and are also found near freeway on and off-ramps. **Never change lanes over double solid white lines**; wait until you see a single broken white line.
- **Carpool/High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes:**
    - These are reserved for carpools, buses, motorcycles, or low-emission vehicles with decals.
    - You must have a certain number of people in your vehicle (as posted on signs), or be driving a low-emission/zero-emission vehicle with a special DMV-issued decal, or be riding a motorcycle (unless posted otherwise).
    - The road surface is marked with a **diamond symbol and the words "Carpool Lane"**.
    - **Do not cross over double solid lines to enter or exit an HOV lane**; use designated entrances and exits.
    - During a law enforcement stop, move completely onto the right shoulder, even if in the carpool/HOV lane.

**Merging and Exiting Freeways:**

- **Merging onto Highway:**
    - **Highway traffic has the right-of-way**.
    - Be in the proper lane on the on-ramp.
    - Be at or near the speed of traffic.
    - **Merge into highway traffic when safe**; do not stop unless absolutely necessary.
    - Merge into a space large enough for your vehicle.
    - Use your mirrors and turn signals.
    - **Turn your head quickly to look over your shoulder** before changing lanes or merging.
    - Leave three seconds of space between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you.
    - **Do not cross over any solid lines when merging**.
    - If crossing several lanes, signal and cross them one at a time, checking blind spots each time.
    - You need a space that is **a full block (about 300 feet)** on the highway to merge, enter, or exit traffic from a full stop.
- **Exiting a Highway:**
    - Know your exit and be aware of its approach.
    - If changing lanes, do so one at a time, signaling and checking blind spots.
    - When in the proper lane, **signal five seconds (approximately 400 feet) before you exit**.
    - Ensure you are at a safe speed to exit.
    - **Do not cross over any solid lines when exiting**.

**Emergencies and Hazards on Freeways:**

- **Disabled Vehicle:**
    - Safely pull over to the right shoulder.
    - Exit on the right side, away from traffic, if you must get out.
    - Dial 511 or locate a call box for assistance.
    - Return to your vehicle as soon as you can (from the right side) and **stay inside with your seat belt on until help arrives**.
    - Use emergency flashers at your discretion.
    - It is safer to get out and stay away if there is not enough shoulder space, there's a guardrail, or an area to safely stay away from freeway lanes.
- **Freeway Service Patrol (FSP):**
    - The CHP FSP provides **free emergency roadside services in certain areas during commute times** if your vehicle stops running.
    - Services include providing gas, jump-starting, refilling radiators, changing flat tires, and reporting collisions.
    - If FSP cannot start your vehicle, they will tow it (free of charge) to a CHP-approved location.
    - FSP will **not** tow to private repair services/residences, recommend companies, or tow motorcycles. They also won't help collision-involved vehicles unless directed by CHP.
    - Call 511 for FSP information and assistance.
- **Traffic Breaks:** Law enforcement uses traffic breaks to slow or stop traffic for hazard removal, heavy fog, or unusual conditions, and to prevent collisions.
    - Turn on your emergency flashers to warn other drivers.
    - Slowly decrease your speed to the same speed as the officer.
    - Do not brake suddenly unless necessary to avoid a collision.
    - Keep a safe distance from the patrol vehicle and **do not drive past it**.
    - Do not speed up until the officer turns off their emergency lights and traffic allows.
- **Highway Construction:** Highway construction can occur at night, so **reduce your speed in these zones**.
- **Collisions:** If you see a vehicle's emergency flashers ahead, slow down, as there may be a collision or other road emergency. Pass carefully and avoid driving near collisions if possible to allow help to reach injured persons faster.

**Other Considerations:**

- **Bicyclists:** Bicyclists may legally ride on certain sections of freeways where there is no alternate route and bicycling is not forbidden by law.
- **Senior Drivers:** Senior drivers may consider **limiting or not driving on freeways**.
- **Making Space:** Be prepared to make space for vehicles entering freeways, even if you have the right-of-way.

Same with specific events - think through what you're supposed to do if you see a school bus, if two cars come to a stop sign at the same time, etc. If you were driving, do you know what you're supposed to do? If not, or if you're unsure, look it up.
- Use the vehicle you used to practice
- Proof of insurance and registration is needed for your vehicle
- The person will see if you pay attention
- You need to be able to see your surroundings for driving
- Avoid tunnel vision
- Pay close attention to the speed signs
- Watch speed in school zones
- Changing lanes incorrectly is wrong; look at the mirror
- Changing lanes requires safety
- Double turning is difficult, so you need to turn based on your lane
- Learn about the "right of way"
- Stop if there is a stop sign

    - Signal **left or right** depending on the parking spot.
    - Check **both sides** before turning in.
2. **Aligning the Car:**
    
    - If the car isn’t straight, **turn the steering wheel toward the sidewalk** while reversing to straighten it.

## **Two-Stop Sign Rule**

- There are **two beats** at a two-stop sign intersection:
    
    **1st Beat (Initial Stop):**
    
    - Stop.
    - If visibility is clear, and no cars are coming, **proceed** into the intersection.
    
    **2nd Beat (Lean & Look):**
    
    - If visibility is blocked, **lean forward slightly** toward the direction of travel.
    - Look **left and right carefully**.
    - When accelerating, continue **checking both directions** like a burglar.


## **Turning Left at an Intersection**

    ![[Pasted image 20250309133227.png]]

## Simple Parking Guide

### Parking Sequence

1. **Position the Car**: Drive forward parallel to the parking space line.  
    ![[Pasted image 20250224140955.png]]
2. **First Turn**: When the rearview mirror aligns with the space line, turn the steering wheel fully left and move forward.  
    ![[Pasted image 20250224141016.png]]
3. **Second Turn**: When you see the parking space corner in the rearview mirror, turn the wheel fully right.  
    ![[Pasted image 20250224141053.png]]
4. **Reverse In**: Shift into reverse and adjust until your car is parallel with the cars next to it.  
    ![[Pasted image 20250224141110.png]]
5. **Final Adjustment**: Straighten the wheel and continue reversing until perfectly parked.

## Reversing in a Parking Space

- **Parallel Parking Maneuver**:
    1. **Start parallel** to the parking space.
    2. **Turn left** (counterclockwise, like 9 o’clock) when the rearview mirror aligns with the parking space line.
    3. **Turn right** (clockwise, like 3 o’clock) when you see the corner of the parking space in the mirror.
    4. **Straighten the wheel** (12 o’clock) once the car is parallel.

# reversing in a parking space  
This describes a **parallel parking maneuver**, and the key turn in clock-style notation would be:

1. **Start parallel** to the parking space.
2. **Turn left (counterclockwise, like 9 o’clock)** when the rearview mirror aligns with the parking space line.
3. **Turn right (clockwise, like 3 o’clock)** when you see the corner of the parking space in the mirror.
4. **Straighten the wheel (12 o’clock)** once the car is parallel.
