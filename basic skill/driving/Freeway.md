Here's information regarding freeway driving, based on the provided sources:

**General Freeway Information and Rules:**

- **Speed Limit:** The **ideal maximum speed limit on most California highways is 65 mph**, unless otherwise posted.
- **Parking:** It is **illegal to park or leave your vehicle on a freeway**, except in an emergency, when a law enforcement officer requires a stop, or where a stop is specifically permitted. A vehicle stopped, parked, or left standing on a freeway for more than four hours may be removed. If you must stop, park completely off the pavement and stay in your vehicle with doors locked until help arrives.
- **Law Enforcement Stops:** If stopped by law enforcement on a freeway, **move completely onto the right shoulder**, even if you are in a carpool/HOV lane.
- **Double Fine Zones:** Fines are doubled in "Safety Enhanced-Double Fine Zones" and in highway construction or maintenance zones when workers are present.

**Lanes and Lane Usage on Freeways:**

- **Lane Numbering:** Traffic lanes are often numbered, with the **left (or fast) lane called the Number 1 Lane**, and subsequent lanes to the right numbered sequentially (Number 2 Lane, Number 3 Lane, etc.).
- **Passing Lanes:** On multilane roads, the **far-left lane is the passing lane**, used to pass other vehicles.
- **Trucks and Trailers:** When towing a vehicle or trailer, or driving a truck with three or more axles, you **must drive in the far-right lane or a lane marked for slower vehicles**. If no lanes are marked and there are four or more lanes in your direction, you may only drive in the two lanes closest to the right edge of the road.
- **Heavy Traffic/Bad Weather:** In heavy traffic or bad weather, you must drive slower. If another driver wishes to drive faster and is behind you, move to the right. If you choose to drive slower than other traffic, drive in the right lane.
- **Changing Lanes:**
    - Before changing lanes, **signal, check your mirrors, check traffic behind and beside you, and look over your shoulder** in the direction you plan to move to ensure the lane is clear.
    - Check your blind spots for other vehicles, motorcyclists, and bicyclists.
    - Ensure there is enough space for your vehicle.
    - It is not necessary to slow down before a lane change.
    - **Stay in one lane as much as possible** and avoid weaving in and out of traffic, as last-minute lane changes increase collision risk.
- **Ending Lanes:** Ending freeway lanes are usually marked with **large broken lines**. If you are in such a lane, be prepared to exit or for the lane to end; look for a sign indicating to exit or merge.
- **Double Solid White Lines:** These indicate a lane barrier between regular and preferential use lanes (like carpool lanes) and are also found near freeway on and off-ramps. **Never change lanes over double solid white lines**; wait until you see a single broken white line.
- **Carpool/High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Lanes:**
    - These are reserved for carpools, buses, motorcycles, or low-emission vehicles with decals.
    - You must have a certain number of people in your vehicle (as posted on signs), or be driving a low-emission/zero-emission vehicle with a special DMV-issued decal, or be riding a motorcycle (unless posted otherwise).
    - The road surface is marked with a **diamond symbol and the words "Carpool Lane"**.
    - **Do not cross over double solid lines to enter or exit an HOV lane**; use designated entrances and exits.
    - During a law enforcement stop, move completely onto the right shoulder, even if in the carpool/HOV lane.

**Merging and Exiting Freeways:**

- **Merging onto Highway:**
    - **Highway traffic has the right-of-way**.
    - Be in the proper lane on the on-ramp.
    - Be at or near the speed of traffic.
    - **Merge into highway traffic when safe**; do not stop unless absolutely necessary.
    - Merge into a space large enough for your vehicle.
    - Use your mirrors and turn signals.
    - **Turn your head quickly to look over your shoulder** before changing lanes or merging.
    - Leave three seconds of space between your vehicle and the vehicle in front of you.
    - **Do not cross over any solid lines when merging**.
    - If crossing several lanes, signal and cross them one at a time, checking blind spots each time.
    - You need a space that is **a full block (about 300 feet)** on the highway to merge, enter, or exit traffic from a full stop.
- **Exiting a Highway:**
    - Know your exit and be aware of its approach.
    - If changing lanes, do so one at a time, signaling and checking blind spots.
    - When in the proper lane, **signal five seconds (approximately 400 feet) before you exit**.
    - Ensure you are at a safe speed to exit.
    - **Do not cross over any solid lines when exiting**.

**Emergencies and Hazards on Freeways:**

- **Disabled Vehicle:**
    - Safely pull over to the right shoulder.
    - Exit on the right side, away from traffic, if you must get out.
    - Dial 511 or locate a call box for assistance.
    - Return to your vehicle as soon as you can (from the right side) and **stay inside with your seat belt on until help arrives**.
    - Use emergency flashers at your discretion.
    - It is safer to get out and stay away if there is not enough shoulder space, there's a guardrail, or an area to safely stay away from freeway lanes.
- **Freeway Service Patrol (FSP):**
    - The CHP FSP provides **free emergency roadside services in certain areas during commute times** if your vehicle stops running.
    - Services include providing gas, jump-starting, refilling radiators, changing flat tires, and reporting collisions.
    - If FSP cannot start your vehicle, they will tow it (free of charge) to a CHP-approved location.
    - FSP will **not** tow to private repair services/residences, recommend companies, or tow motorcycles. They also won't help collision-involved vehicles unless directed by CHP.
    - Call 511 for FSP information and assistance.
- **Traffic Breaks:** Law enforcement uses traffic breaks to slow or stop traffic for hazard removal, heavy fog, or unusual conditions, and to prevent collisions.
    - Turn on your emergency flashers to warn other drivers.
    - Slowly decrease your speed to the same speed as the officer.
    - Do not brake suddenly unless necessary to avoid a collision.
    - Keep a safe distance from the patrol vehicle and **do not drive past it**.
    - Do not speed up until the officer turns off their emergency lights and traffic allows.
- **Highway Construction:** Highway construction can occur at night, so **reduce your speed in these zones**.
- **Collisions:** If you see a vehicle's emergency flashers ahead, slow down, as there may be a collision or other road emergency. Pass carefully and avoid driving near collisions if possible to allow help to reach injured persons faster.

**Other Considerations:**

- **Bicyclists:** Bicyclists may legally ride on certain sections of freeways where there is no alternate route and bicycling is not forbidden by law.
- **Senior Drivers:** Senior drivers may consider **limiting or not driving on freeways**.
- **Making Space:** Be prepared to make space for vehicles entering freeways, even if you have the right-of-way.
