## professor  building relationship 

### **Best People to Ask**

- **S-tier**: Professors you’ve worked closely with (e.g., through research, long-term projects, or frequent conversations).
    
- **A-tier**: Professors you visited regularly during office hours or took multiple courses with and performed well in.
    
- **B-tier**: Professors who only taught you once or twice but you did very well in their class—less personal, mostly reflects grades.
    
- **Others**: Postdocs, graduate students, or lecturers **only** if you had meaningful academic interaction—ideally just one LOR from a grad student, and better if co-signed by a faculty member.
    

---

### **How to Build Relationships**

- Attend office hours regularly.
    
- Engage meaningfully in seminars or discussions.
    
- Ask questions, seek feedback on papers/projects, and maintain email contact (especially important during remote learning).
    

---

### **When and How to Ask**

- Ask early—at least a month in advance.
    
- Be respectful and polite.
    
- Confirm that they feel comfortable writing a **strong** letter.
    
- Provide a document with:
    
    - Courses you took with them.
        
    - Your performance and standout work.
        
    - Your academic goals and interests.
        

---

### **Other Tips**

- It’s okay to take time after undergrad before applying to grad school.
    
- Don’t let anxiety stop you—many professors are happy to help.
    
- Rejection is not the end—ask others and move forward.
    

---

### **TL;DR**

Ask professors you've formed meaningful academic connections with, especially through research, multiple classes, or office hour conversations. Start early, communicate clearly, and don’t be afraid to reach out—even during remote learning.

# [research ](https://www.reddit.com/user/elucidateobfuscation/)
I graduated from undergrad in 2020 and will be starting an MD/PhD in the summer, so I do apologize if things are out of date or biased towards medicine/biological sciences! To condense some of the resources out there to try:

**Structured UCSD Specific Programs**

**1) Academic Internship Program** (AIP - [https://aip.ucsd.edu/](https://aip.ucsd.edu/)): where you can get credit via a 97 or 197 course while working in internship opportunities, and more specific examples include things like the Biology Research Internship Program (BISP 197 - [https://aip.ucsd.edu/whatwedo/bisp197.html](https://aip.ucsd.edu/whatwedo/bisp197.html))

**2) Faculty Mentor Program** (FMP - [https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/programs/all-urh-programs/fmp/index.html](https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/programs/all-urh-programs/fmp/index.html)): where you get credit via 99 or 199 courses centered around research with faculty mentors

**3) Undergraduate Research Hub** (URH - [https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/programs/all-urh-programs/index.html](https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/programs/all-urh-programs/index.html)): includes the FMP program mentioned above, but this is the more general list of all the programs out there available!

**General Research Opportunity Postings/Opportunities**

**1) Research Experience and Applied Learning Portal** (REAL - [https://real.ucsd.edu/](https://real.ucsd.edu/)): general listing of faculty/opportunities in different areas/different kinds of positions for them

**2) Handshake** ([https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/login](https://ucsd.joinhandshake.com/login)): a more formalized listing of jobs, internships, etc. including from companies as well as other research institutions nearby

**Nearby Research Institutes/Opportunities**

**1) Salk** ([https://www.salk.edu/science/directory/faculty/](https://www.salk.edu/science/directory/faculty/)): fantastic place for countless different areas of biological research

**2) Sanford Burnham Prebys** ([https://sbpdiscovery.org/our-scientists](https://sbpdiscovery.org/our-scientists)): another great place to check out

**General Advice**

I've been involved with the selection, interviewing, and final decision process when hiring a new assistant before. This is specific to how that lab considers lab assistants/research assistants, but I'm sure other labs consider these factors too.

We look for things like:

**1) How much time you'll have and how it's distributed** - we'd prefer at least 10 hours/week for an assistant position, and we'd rather have it in larger chunks (ex: 5 hour blocks) rather than many small chunks (ex: five 2 hour blocks). We also prefer more regular hours (ex: during the 8 am - 5 pm chunk) over other schedules (ex: if you can only work from 6 pm - 10 pm).

**2) Any prior experience (prior work, classes, etc)** - it just helps/makes training faster, but not required, and/or shows what you may be able to get started with or work towards during your time here/how you can contribute

**3) Commitment** - if you're only looking to stay for a short amount of time, it's less likely that you'll be selected (ex: places prefer someone with a 1+ year commitment vs someone just staying for the summer). This has an added benefit of the fact that you can sometimes transition from a lab assistant to research assistant. One of my former lab coworkers began as a lab assistant before transitioning to a research assistant within a year or so.

**4) Demonstrated interest** - knowing about what the lab does at a rough/high level, submitting other helpful materials like a cover letter (may not be required but definitely is noticed when it was included), etc. all helps!

**Don't be discouraged!** There's a lot of people and just not enough spots for everyone and many professors/people get lots of emails and things can just slip through the cracks. In the current lab I work at, our undergrad had to follow up 3x since our PI is a physician, but he explicitly commented on appreciating the dedication and effort (not to say this works in every case). In my case, I went through like 20-50+ cold emails before getting any response/interest and I had no prior research experience.

Hope this helps and good luck!

Edit: happy to help further/answer any more questions with getting research, med stuff (if applicable to you), etc.!
