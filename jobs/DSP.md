there is a person specialize in computer vision with embedded in this thread 
## learning with embedded

Here are two books on embedded DSP for ARM architectures that I see recommended frequently:

- Digital Signal Processing Using the ARM Cortex M4 by Donald S. Reay
    
- The Definitive Guide to ARM® Cortex®-M3 and Cortex®-M4 Processors by Joseph Yiu (Chapters 21 and 22 specifically; written by Paul Beckmann)
    

Personally, I learned a lot from Chapter 21 of Yiu's book. It goes into how you can optimize for the M4's instruction set



#Todo_question 
Great question — talking to someone already in the field is a smart way to figure out if it’s truly for you. Since you’re already a strong match based on your interests and skills, asking the right questions can help you connect emotionally and practically to the work.

Here are **key questions** you should ask a computer hardware engineer to help you better understand and appreciate the field:

---

### 🔧 **Understanding the Work**

1. **What does a typical day look like for you?**
    
2. **What kind of projects do you work on most often?**
    
3. **What hardware tools or technologies do you use regularly?**
    

---

### 💡 **Motivation and Satisfaction**

4. **Wh do you enjoy most about being a computer hardware engineer?**
    
5. **What was the moment you knew this was the right career for you?**
    
6. **What part of the job challenges or excites you the most?**
    

---

### 🧠 **Getting Into the Mindset**

7. **What mindset or habits helped you succeed in this field?**
    
8. **How did you start gaining confidence in your engineering or problem-solving skills?**
    

---

### 🛠️ **Building Skills and Experience**

9. **What should someone interested in this field start learning or doing right now?**
    
10. **Are there any beginner projects or kits you’d recommend to get hands-on experience?**
    

---

### 🗣️ **Real Talk**

11. **What’s one thing people misunderstand about computer hardware engineering?**
    
12. **If you could go back and give your younger self advice, what would it be?**
    

---

These questions are designed not just to gather facts but to **spark your curiosity** and help you **emotionally connect** with what they do. After your conversation, reflect on which answers sparked your interest or made you feel excited — that’s your guide.
