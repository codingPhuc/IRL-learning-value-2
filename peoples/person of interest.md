- She appears distressed when her son talks back.
- She doesn't seem to care about others' opinions.

**Reflections on Your Wrongdoing:**
- You regret eating an entire chicken despite being told otherwise.
- In Vietnamese culture, sincerity may sometimes mask true feelings; you should be cautious.
- You need to be more proactive and communicate your problems more openly.
- Pay closer attention when Nhung lectures her son, Tai.
- Think before you speak, especially in sensitive situations.
- When your mom makes a suggestion, it often actually means an expectation — clarify if it's really a suggestion.
- When offered food, you should eat minimally and only when suggested.
