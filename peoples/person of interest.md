**Summary:**



**About Nhung:**
- Nhung is a mother of three (children aged 12, 5, and 1) visiting on a business visa.
- She seems to enjoy knitting (as seen on Facebook).
- She loves dogs.
- She tends to say everything is fine even when it's not.
- She appears distressed when her son talks back.
- She doesn't seem to care about others' opinions.
- You made an inappropriate joke today about men liking fat women.
**Reflections on Your Wrongdoing:**
- You regret eating an entire chicken despite being told otherwise.
- In Vietnamese culture, sincerity may sometimes mask true feelings; you should be cautious.
- You need to be more proactive and communicate your problems more openly.
- Pay closer attention when Nhung lectures her son, Tai.
- Think before you speak, especially in sensitive situations.
- When your mom makes a suggestion, it often actually means an expectation — clarify if it's really a suggestion.
- When offered food, you should eat minimally and only when suggested.
