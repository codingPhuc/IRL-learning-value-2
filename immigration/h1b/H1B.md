Here's a summary of the advice shared by users in the Reddit thread, which seems to focus on dealing with a layoff while on an H1B visa, managing the visa process, and navigating job searches:

### 1. **Job Search & Networking:**

- **Be proactive and fast:** Begin applying for jobs immediately after your layoff. Don't delay; every day counts.
- **Target strong fits:** Focus on applying to roles that match your skills and qualifications well. Employers may not respond to roles where you're a weak match.
- **Reach out to your network:** Inform your network, post on LinkedIn, and ask friends, colleagues, or acquaintances for referrals or advice.
- **Consider lower-level roles:** If you were in a managerial position, consider exploring individual contributor roles as there may be more of these in the market.

### 2. **Visa and Immigration Advice:**

- **H1B Sponsorship:** Always ask recruiters if the company sponsors H1B visas early in your conversations to avoid wasting time.
- **Switching to B2 Visa:** If you’re nearing the end of your 60-day grace period after a layoff, you may apply for a B2 visa (tourist visa) to stay in the country while continuing your job search.
- **Alternatives to H1B:** Some suggest applying for a B1/B2 visa, although it has restrictions. Alternatively, exploring the EB1 or EB2-NIW (National Interest Waiver) green card options, if applicable, can also be considered.
- **Resume Tips:** Ensure your resume clearly indicates your visa status (H1B or B2) so potential employers understand your situation. Professional resume writing services (like those on Fiverr) helped some people land more interviews.

### 3. **Mental & Emotional Support:**

- **Stay positive and persistent:** It’s tough, but keep pushing through. Seek moral support from job support groups or communities of others going through similar experiences.
- **Plan for your mental health:** Some shared how taking breaks, considering a hobby, or even taking a year off to re-energize can provide clarity.
- **Be ready for rejection:** Understand that it’s not necessarily about your skills. Companies are looking for a "plug-and-play" solution, so be ready to sell yourself as that.

### 4. **Practical Actions:**

- **Visa Timeline:** Pay attention to your visa expiration and the 60-day grace period. Apply for visa extensions early if needed and ensure you have enough financial resources to support your stay.
- **Train and Upskill:** Continue improving your skill set, especially in areas relevant to your industry.
- **Self-Employment or Starting a Business:** Some individuals explored starting their own business in their home country (India) as a way to buy time or align their career goals while still working on a green card.

### 5. **Additional Thoughts:**

- **Backup Plans:** Always have a plan B, but focus on your primary goal: landing a new job.
- **Hard Work and Resilience:** Understand that the job search process is challenging, but it’s about persistence, adaptability, and finding the right fit.

### Final Note:

Though it’s a tough situation, many emphasize that "what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger." Keep pushing, exploring all options, and stay connected with your network.

went through this tough situation recently. it was made much worse by the fact that i was laid off in december, during holiday season. you’ll get through it, here’s how-

1. Most important - focus on jobs posted within the last 24-48 hours, and jobs where you are a STRONG candidate for the role. You won’t get calls for a role where you only match 60% of the job description.
    
2. If you don’t find a job within the 60 day window, you can apply for a B1/B2 visa BEFORE THE 60th DAY. You can continue searching for jobs if you have a receipt notice for your B1/B2 visa
    
3. Other options I pursued turned out to be impossible, due to H1B restrictions. Can’t open your own company or join a friend’s small company (unless there’s enough revenue to justify hiring an H1B employee).
    
4. BONUS TIP - If you’re getting no calls, consider paying for resume writing services. I got my resume and linkedin written by a professional, and started getting a lot more calls. i eventually landed a job that i didn’t know existed, because a recruiter found me on linkedin and liked my profile.
    

More general thoughts - focus on networking, and make the job search your current full time job. Understand that employers are being absolute dicks to candidates right now, and it has nothing to do with your skills. Feel absolutely no shame in exaggerating your accomplishments to fit a job description, but be sure to do a lot of research/studying to back it up in an interview. Remember, companies think they should be able to ‘plug in and play’ employees, and not train them. Try your best in every interview to convince them you’re the ‘plug in and play’ employee for that specific role.

It sounds like you're discussing the challenges and strategies related to finding H1B visa sponsorship, particularly in the tech industry. Here are a few key takeaways from the conversation:

1. **FAANG Companies & H1B Sponsorship:** Some believe large tech companies like FAANG avoid "power moves" by not committing to H1B sponsorship from the outset. However, these companies often require a performance review or trial period before considering sponsorship.
    
2. **H1B Sponsorship Databases:** Websites like [h1bdata.info](https://h1bdata.info/), [h1bvisajobs.com](https://h1bvisajobs.com/), and government resources (e.g., the Department of Labor’s performance data) can help job seekers identify companies that have sponsored H1B visas in the past.
    
3. **Non-Cap Employers:** Nonprofit organizations and universities can file H1B petitions year-round without being subject to the annual cap, though their pay might be slightly lower than for-profit employers.
    
4. **Networking & University Connections:** Leveraging university alumni networks and LinkedIn connections can be effective in finding companies willing to sponsor H1B visas.
    
5. **Burden on Employers:** U.S. law requires companies to prioritize hiring American citizens or green card holders before sponsoring H1B visas, making the process burdensome for employers due to extra paperwork and legal obligations.
    

These insights show that while the path to securing an H1B sponsorship can be challenging, there are resources and strategies available to improve your chances.
