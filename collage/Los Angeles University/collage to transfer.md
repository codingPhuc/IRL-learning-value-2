@UCI when would you have to submit the tag application? Asking for a rising high school senior.
Nancy | UC Irvine 01:11 PM 
Hi Mary, the submission period for TAG is September 1 - September 30 every year. It is advised that students meet with a counselor at their community college transfer center to build an academic plan that will allow them to work towards transfer, TAG and major requirements. When a high school senior would be eligible to submit will depend on that academic plan.

Could student change their major after transfer to Berkeley?
Maika Jimenez 01:22 PM 
It depends on which major you want to switch into since there are some majors that do not allow students to switch in once you have been admitted under a different major. But if it’s something like switching from Anthropology to Sociology, you most likely are able to especially if you make the switch in that first semseter.

@UCI so to be clear, the tag application must be done while the student is a senior in high school, correct? Would the student still be able to apply to UCI as a regular applicant as well or is it one or the other?
Nancy | UC Irvine 01:23 PM 
Hello Mary, TAG is only available to community college students meaning high schools students must graduate and attend community college in order to be eligible to TAG. If your student is a high school senior with community college course credit they would need to apply to UCI as a regular freshman applicant.

Lorenzo Morales 01:14 PM  
@UCSB hiya! I was wondering how pre-majors work, like the Film and Media Studies major, for transfer students?
Jessica - UC Santa Barbara 01:18 PM 
Hi Lorenzo! Students admitted as Pre-Film and Media Studies. Students are admitted initially to Pre-Film and Media Studies, not directly to the major. Students will be admitted to full Film and Media Studies major status only after they complete Film and Media Studies 46, 70, and 96 with no grade below C, and with a grade-point average of at least 2.0 in all pre-major courses completed at the University of California. (Only UC grades go into the pre-major GPA. Transfer courses taken outside of UC may satisfy pre-major requirements, but they are not part of the pre-major GPA.). For detailed information on pre-major requirements, please visit Assist.org

Luis Rodriguez-Martinez (UCSB) 01:19 PM 
Certain major preparation requirements may have to be met prior to transfer, across different UCs. If a major requirement is listed as not required for all of the major prep, then you may apply to that UC which does not ask for required major prep. Granted most UCs ask for requried classes to be met for transfer into Bio

Are we required to graduate within 2 years, or can we extend by a semester or two? (for all UCs)
Shawntelle B. | UC Santa Cruz 01:19 PM 
You can extend as needed but you will work with your advisor to do so. Somethings to keep in mind is that financial aid may not always cover you passed two years (depends on the student) and it may cost more overall to saty longer. Our main goal though is to get you that degree within two years

Luis Rodriguez-Martinez (UCSB) 01:24 PM 
In this case if a class says its required but there is no articulated agreement for that required class, then we would recommened students look to colleges near their area to meet the required major prep. However if it is not possible nor feasible you could mention it on your UC application. However, please email lrodriguez-martinez@ucsb.edu to set up an appointment and get further assistance.

@UCLA If I complete the honors and TAP, will that better my chances of getting in? I have a 4.0 GPA, honors president's list, honors mentor, PTK officer, VP of student news paper and regularly volunteer with my school
Sabrina Nuño | UCLA 01:32 PM 
Hi! Yes, completing your school's Honors program/TAP does improve your chances of admission. UCLA gives priority consideration to students who complete an approved honors program and are TAP certified. On top of that, your 4.0 GPA, leadership roles, and volunteer work make you a competitive applicant overall. Keep up the great work!

You may list the CCS Art major as your first choice, yet if you do so your TAG may not be eligible, as your first choice majors on the UC application and TAP have to match. Students may choose to list CCS Art as their primary choice and as well as list College of Letters and Science Art (CL&S) as thier alternative choice major in order to increase ones chances for admissions into UCSB.

If you have only attended community college then you can not reach senior standing and you should definitley apply as a junior. If you have attended a 4 year university it is possible that you could be in senior standing, but it will depend on what coursework transfers. I recommend speaking with the campus(es) you are interested in applying to, but you can always submit the application as a junior so that we can review it.

Could student change their major after transfer to Berkeley?
Maika Jimenez 01:22 PM 
It depends on which major you want to switch into since there are some majors that do not allow students to switch in once you have been admitted under a different major. But if it’s something like switching from Anthropology to Sociology, you most likely are able to especially if you make the switch in that first semseter.

@UCSB hiya! I was wondering how pre-majors work, like the Film and Media Studies major, for transfer students?
Jessica - UC Santa Barbara 01:18 PM 
Hi Lorenzo! Students admitted as Pre-Film and Media Studies. Students are admitted initially to Pre-Film and Media Studies, not directly to the major. Students will be admitted to full Film and Media Studies major status only after they complete Film and Media Studies 46, 70, and 96 with no grade below C, and with a grade-point average of at least 2.0 in all pre-major courses completed at the University of California. (Only UC grades go into the pre-major GPA. Transfer courses taken outside of UC may satisfy pre-major requirements, but they are not part of the pre-major GPA.).

Certain major preparation requirements may have to be met prior to transfer, across different UCs.

Granted most UCs ask for requried classes to be met for transfer into Bio

You can extend as needed but you will work with your advisor to do so. Somethings to keep in mind is that financial aid may not always cover you passed two years (depends on the student) and it may cost more overall to saty longer. Our main goal though is to get you that degree within two years

Should I submit my TAG application first and wait for the decision first? Or should I just submit my UC applications as soon as they're open?
Jessica - UC Santa Barbara 01:36 PM 
Hello! UCSB does not do early evaluation for TAG applicants. Students will be notified mid-late April if they have been admitted to UCSB.
Lorenzo Morales 01:35 PM  
@UCSB hi! Would you prefer that we fill out the spring semester with classes for the TAP/TAG application? Or should it be left blank?
Luis Rodriguez-Martinez (UCSB) 01:37 PM 
Yes, you are able to list courses as 'planned' and that is fine. You would be able to update your grades and classes during the time for the TAU (transfer academic update) when students have submitted their UC application.

Can you apply to a UC with TAG and regular application?
Cesar | UC Riverside 01:38 PM 
Hi, yes, in order for your TAG application to ONE campus to go through you must also apply regular admission to that campus and list the exact same major as listed on the TAG application. For the general application you can apple to as many campuses as you'd like.

Does all of the assist required for admission courses to be completed before transfering? If I am in the process of completing some of those courses by my application submission, will that affect my admission?
Fabian Meneses | UC Davis 01:40 PM 
Assist highlights all course options; there is a difference between coursework required for admissions vs coursework required to graduate in that major. I advise checking in with each college you are interested in to determine the course priority.
Aracely Ruiz 01:38 PM  
Hi, sorry if this has already been asked. I’m an out-of-state student and I just had some general questions about classes and wanted to go over my credits. What’s the best way to get in touch with an academic advisor if I can’t meet in person?

my son is in community college but struggling and figuring out what he wants to do. Can he do TAG if he is in his 3rd or 4th year of community college
Jessica - UC Santa Barbara 01:41 PM 
Students can TAG to a UC campus as long as they meet the full TAG requirements for their campus. UC campuses review for unit count and minimum eligibility, not the length of time a student has been at the community college.
Elijah Bryce 01:39 PM  
If I have a grade that negatively affects my GPA in fall 2025 and retake in the spring of 2026, how will that affect my admission process for fall 2026?

When we evaluate your application, the defficient grade will be used in your GPA calculation. Your Spring 2026 grades will not be used in the evaluation. It's important to do well Fall 2025.

@UCI can you transfer from CC to into UCI as a sophmore
Nancy | UC Irvine 01:44 PM 
UCI does not accept lower division level transfers. For TAG specifically, a student must complete 60 semester units by the end of their spring semester. This means that students will TAG / transfer with junior level standing.

I have a question regarding Senior-Level transfer students. I am regarded as a senior-level transfer due the amount of credits I have, but I have since changed my major. I was wondering if I would apply as a Junior-Level transfer or a senior-level transfer since I will be taking Junior-level courses?
Lisa Overstreet - UCD 01:48 PM 
If you have only attended community college then you can not reach senior standing and you should definitley apply as a junior. If you have attended a 4 year university it is possible that you could be in senior standing, but it will depend on what coursework transfers. I recommend speaking with the campus(es) you are interested in applying to, but you can always submit the application as a junior so that we can review it. If you are in fact in senior standing we will determine that when we review your application.

For example if I am able to skip the first Physics class from an AP score and I take the next course in the sequence will that affect my admissions?
