 **Through the Gate: Moving Students Through the Transfer Pipeline**

The Transfer Center Support project will assist with increasing the numbers moving through the transfer pipeline. Targeted outreach, using the “Through the Gate” transfer study (RP Group) will be utilized to outreach to students in a case-management method within three different target groups, starting with those who meet requirements, in progress to meet requirements in a given year, and new students who declare a transfer intent.
