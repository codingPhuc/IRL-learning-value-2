bases on the health service  what I gather is that : 
1. there are basic care procedure   ,  some like TB skin testing ,  Mental health therapy  , Immunizations and Medications are use full for me and additional  thing 
2. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy I need to find out if I am autistic  or not . This can be use full when applying for scholarship

## Other Info
1. The proof of finance I need is about $27k.
2. You can take as little as 12 units of class at Golden West.
3. Courses that need to be taken:
   1. I cannot ask for info about courses that I need to take too much due to the counsel not giving info to non-students.
   2. The transfer counsel said that I can take any courses I want, but the info seems to be unclear whether there are additional strings attached.
