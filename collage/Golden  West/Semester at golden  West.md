- [Paul Swendson](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/435624) 

https://goldenwestcollege.bncollege.com/course-material-listing-page?bypassCustomerAdoptions=true
This professor has a highly mixed bag of reviews, with a significant split between those who find him engaging and fair, and those who find him unprofessional, biased, and a tough grader. However, a clear pattern emerges on how to approach his class and tests.

Here's a summary of the information and a plan to pass his tests:

**Summary of Professor Swendson's Class:**

- **Teaching Style:**
    - **Lectures:** Often described as "amazing," "entertaining," "hilarious," "engaging," and "passionate." He has a "dark sense of humor" and a "unique perspective." Some find them "boring" or "lecture heavy."
    - **Content:** Covers US history. Some reviews mention he gives his opinions on historical events without full context or expresses liberal/Democratic views, which some find biased. One alarming review mentions inappropriate sexual content in his self-written book.
    - **Online Class:** He has experience with online classes and can be clear on objectives. However, some online students reported a lack of engagement or feedback.
- **Textbooks:**
    - **Required:** Almost always requires textbooks, sometimes three in total.
    - **His Own Book:** He often requires or highly suggests a book he wrote himself. Reviews are split: some find it helpful for breaking down material, while others criticize its content (lack of context, inappropriate topics).
    - **"America Firsthand" / Articles:** A frequently mentioned required book for essays and specific details on quizzes.
- **Assessments:**
    - **Quizzes:** Frequent (6-7 quizzes, sometimes pop quizzes). They are a significant portion of the grade. Often described as "difficult," "oddly worded," "tough," and requiring memorization of subtle details from readings. Some are straightforward if you read, others require deep understanding of lectures and readings.
    - **Tests/Exams:** Generally consist of multiple-choice and written questions. They can be "insanely hard" if you don't study thoroughly.
    - **Essays/Written Portion:** A common component of quizzes/tests, often based on the "America Firsthand" book or assigned articles.
    - **Homework/Assignments:** Reviews are mixed; some say "lots of homework," others say "no homework." It seems assignments might be integrated into quizzes or review materials.
    - **Participation:** Matters in some classes.
    - **Extra Credit:** Often offered, but usually only one opportunity.
- **Grading:**
    - **Clear Criteria:** Many reviews state he has "very clear grading criteria" at the start of the semester.
    - **Tough Grader:** Frequently mentioned, especially for written work and quizzes.
    - **Grade Distribution:** Some mention a high failure rate, with few A's and B's.
    - **Drops Lowest Quiz:** Often drops the lowest quiz score.
- **Professor's Demeanor:**
    - **Helpful/Accessible:** Some find him understanding, approachable, and accessible outside class.
    - **Rude/Unprofessional:** Others describe him as sarcastic, rude, and unprofessional, especially in email responses. One extreme review highlights "inconsiderate thoughts on sexual topics and toys" in his book.
    - **Biased:** Several reviews mention his strong liberal/Democratic leanings and how he expresses them in class.

**Plan to Pass His Tests:**

Given the conflicting reviews, especially regarding his professionalism and the content of his own book, it's crucial to be prepared and strategic.

1. **Prioritize Reading (Especially the Assigned Articles/Firsthand Book):**
    
    - **This is the #1 takeaway.** Almost every review, positive or negative, emphasizes the importance of reading.
    - **His Own Book:** Read it, but be prepared for potentially problematic content (as noted by some reviews). If you encounter anything inappropriate or triggering, document it and consider reporting it to the college if you feel it's necessary. Focus on the factual or historical points he makes, and be aware of his opinions.
    - **"America Firsthand" / Other Articles:** These are critical for the written portions of tests and for specific quiz questions. Read them carefully and take detailed notes, focusing on subtle details, themes, and perspectives. Memorize key aspects.
    - **Read Actively:** Don't just skim. Read for understanding, context, and specific details.
2. **Attend Lectures and Take Meticulous Notes:**
    
    - **Mandatory Attendance (Often):** Many reviews indicate attendance is mandatory or highly recommended.
    - **Lecture-Heavy Tests:** A significant portion of quiz and test questions come directly from his lectures.
    - **Supplement PowerPoints:** His powerpoints might be brief. Add your own detailed notes from what he _says_ in class, not just what's on the slide. Pay attention to his elaborations, examples, and discussions.
    - **Engage (Cautiously):** While participation matters, be mindful of the "sarcastic/rude" and "biased" reviews. If he discusses controversial topics, be prepared to engage respectfully or hold your tongue if you feel it will lead to an unproductive confrontation.
3. **Understand the Quizzes:**
    
    - **Frequent & Tough:** Expect challenging quizzes.
    - **Combine Lecture and Reading:** Quizzes draw from both lectures and readings. Don't rely on just one.
    - **Study for Specifics:** Be ready for questions on obscure details from readings and specific points from lectures.
    - **Prepare for Pop Quizzes:** If he's known for them, review recent material before every class.
4. **Leverage Available Resources:**
    
    - **Syllabus/Clear Grading Criteria:** Pay close attention to the syllabus at the beginning of the semester. He is reportedly clear on grading criteria, so use this to your advantage to understand how your grade will be calculated.
    - **Extra Credit:** If offered, _do it_. It can be crucial for boosting your grade.
    - **Professor Accessibility:** If you have questions about material, try reaching out. While some find him rude, others find him approachable. Frame your questions clearly and politely.
5. **Time Management:**
    
    - **"Get Ready to Read":** This tag appears on almost every review. The sheer volume of reading requires excellent time management. Don't fall behind.
    - **Manage Homework:** If there is "lots of homework," factor that into your weekly schedule.
6. **Be Aware of Potential Bias/Controversial Content:**
    
    - **Personal Opinions:** He interjects his personal opinions. Be prepared to differentiate between historical fact and his commentary.
    - **Sensitive Topics:** The review mentioning "inconsiderate thoughts on sexual topics and toys" in his book is a significant red flag. If you are uncomfortable with such content, be prepared to address it (e.g., talk to him, department head, student services) or consider dropping the class if it's a severe issue. Document any such instances.

By diligently following this plan, especially the emphasis on comprehensive reading and detailed note-taking from both lectures and texts, you'll significantly increase your chances of passing his tests and achieving a good grade in Professor Swendson's class.
Sure! Here's a cleaner and more readable format for the information you provided:
