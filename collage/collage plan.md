## Recommended Colleges

Based on proximity, there are three recommendations:

2. **El Camino College**
3. **Los Angeles City College (LACC)**

## Action Plan  
there will  be  3  plan  ,  plan  A   plan B and  plan C    
plan A will be the best school  too transfer(bases on reputation ) too the most even  if it cost me an arm and a leg 
plan B  will be the best school too transfer(bases on reputation )  but will   not  be prioritize like  plan A  (like  the  course to transfer will not align  perfectly ) 
plan C will be the best school too transfer(bases on cost  ,  and  location ) 

For most majors, choose the most transferable subjects for the electrical program.

Recommended action plan:
1. Call the school counselor to see which credits are transferable.
2. Evaluate the three colleges above for:
   1. Most transferable rate
   2. Low cost expense
   3. Specific useful degree
3. California community:
   - Ask for administration contacts like [Irvine Valley College - Counseling Center Contact](#), [[El Camino College]], and [Los Angeles City College (LACC)](#).
   - Then call the contact council of [California State University](#).

## Transfer Rate Analysis

Based on the file showing the agreement with transfer rate:
- **Most Transferable Rate**
  1. El Camino College
  2. Los Angeles City College (LACC)
  3. Irvine Valley College

- **Low Cost Expense**
  1. El Camino College
  2. Los Angeles City College (LACC)
  3. Irvine Valley College

- **Specific Useful Degree**
  - All three colleges

Based on the analysis, **El Camino College** seems to be the greatest deal.

## Questions to Ask

1. What major should I pursue at El Camino College to transfer to California State University?
2. Which courses should I take to get into California State University? (e.g., Math, Pre-Engineering, Circuit Analysis, Digital System, Computer Logic Circuit Analysis, Introduction to Engineering)

## California dream act 


u/Beginning_Avocado807
I am late here, but leaving this comment for anyone facing the same issue (as I did too). As international students, we are not eligible to fill out FAFSA; however, many schools require you to do so to process your loan if you're taking it from the US. Since we cannot fill out the FAFSA online, what we gotta do is take a printout of the form, fill it out, and mail it to the address that is mentioned on the form. Once FAFSA receives your application, they reject it (since you are an international student), and you need to then inform your school of this. The school will then go ahead and sanction that loan for you, Hope this helps

just apply california dream act, it’s basically fafsa for students who are not citizens or green card holders but have lived here for a very long time. as long as you’ve graduated from a californian school and studied here for more than three years you qualify. look into ab540 and CADAA. you’ll also be considered as domestic student for admission purposes for public schools like UC and CSU if you graduate here.

And usually international students don't have Social Security Number (SSN) so don't need to mention.

I hope it will help you, feel free to ask for further help.

IT depends on the University you go because colleges will deem you more eligible for certain institutional aid. Federal Aid like the Pell Grant covers up to 6 years while the Cal grant which is state aid covers up to 4. Certain instuitions like CSULB which is where I go, allows you to get something called a State University Grant(SUG) which you are eligible for until you reach 150 Earned units(which is essentially 5 years of education).

It also depends on your financial situation too. They use a measurement called the Expected Family Contribution(EFC) which essentially measures your total family income and see if you are eligible for certain awards, If your income goes up in the past two years since you've filled out the most recent DREAM Act. Then you may not be eligible for certain grants or awards.

you could also check mygrant like JMC said as well.

Hi people, I only qualify for the California Dream Act and not FAFSA so maybe not everyone might be able to answer

I received aid late July and still had to pay $600+ out of pocket for every semester, this was a University Grant. Then 2 weeks later, I am notified that I was awarded a Cal Grant and I see I only have to pay $250 out of pocket each semester. See, my question is, why was the University Grant money replaced with the State Grant? Why can't I be awarded both? I know of people who are Dream Act recipients at other cal states and have $700+ to spare each term.

Also there's the Dreamers Scholarship given by the University, its $1500 per term, I was awrded this 2 years ago but they did the same thing with the funds, they replaced the state funds with the scholarship and I never got to cash a scholarship check.

Anyone know why they do this? I need to buy my bus pass :(

##   qualify for California dream act

### question  
If you're looking to ask about the **California Dream Act (CADAA)** and related financial aid, here are some key questions to consider:

### **Eligibility & Application Process**

1. What are the eligibility requirements for the California Dream Act? x 
2. How do I apply, and what documents do I need? 
3. When is the deadline to apply for CADAA each year? 
4. Do I need to reapply every year, and does my award amount change?
5. Can I apply if I am in the process of adjusting my immigration status?

### **Grants & Scholarships**

1. What types of financial aid can Dream Act recipients receive (e.g., Cal Grant, State University Grant, institutional aid)?
2. How is the **Expected Family Contribution (EFC)** calculated for Dream Act students?
3. Are there additional scholarships specifically for Dream Act students?
4. Can I receive both a **Cal Grant** and a **University Grant**, or do they replace each other?
5. Does receiving outside scholarships affect my state or institutional aid?

### **Loans & Work-Study**

1. Are Dream Act students eligible for student loans? If so, what kind?
2. Can Dream Act students participate in **work-study programs**?
3. What are my options if I still have out-of-pocket expenses after receiving aid?

### **Institution-Specific Policies**

1. How does my university handle Dream Act financial aid differently from other schools?
2. Are there specific Dreamer support services or financial aid advisors I can speak with?
3. Do some universities offer more institutional aid to Dream Act students than others?

### **Other Benefits & Challenges**

1. Can Dream Act recipients qualify for **in-state tuition** at all California public colleges?
2. How do Dream Act students prove residency for tuition purposes (e.g., AB 540, AB 2000, SB 68)?
3. If my financial situation changes, can I appeal my award?
4. How does aid disbursement work, and when will I receive my funds?

These questions should help you get a better understanding of the Dream Act process and how to maximize your financial aid. Would you like me to refine them based on your specific situation?
