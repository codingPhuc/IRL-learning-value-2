If you're looking to get the most out of a conversation with current students or faculty about a computer engineering (CE) program, here are some key questions you could ask:

### **Coursework & Difficulty**

1. What are the hardest classes in the program, and why?
2. Which classes have the heaviest workload or require the most programming?
3. Are there any "weed-out" classes that students struggle with the most?
4. How much math is actually used in upper-level courses?
5. Are there specific professors that are known to be great (or difficult)?

### **Programming & Technical Skills**

1. What programming languages are most commonly used in coursework? x
2. How much hands-on experience do students get with hardware vs. software? 
3. Are there opportunities to work with microcontrollers, FPGAs, or embedded systems?
4. How well does the program prepare students for software-related careers vs. hardware-related careers?

### **Internships & Career Preparation**

1. How easy is it to find internships through the school?
2. Does the department help with networking, career fairs, or resume workshops?
3. Do students feel well-prepared for industry jobs after graduation?
4. How much emphasis is placed on research vs. practical industry skills?

### **Student Experience & Support**

1. How supportive is the CE department? Are professors approachable?
2. How manageable is the workload, especially in later years?
3. Is it common for students to take more than four years to graduate?
4. Are there tutoring or study groups available for tough classes?

### **Electives & Specializations**

1. Are there specializations or elective tracks (e.g., AI, cybersecurity, embedded systems)?
2. What are the most useful electives for industry careers?
3. Are there opportunities to take CS courses alongside CE courses?

These questions should help you get a good sense of what to expect and whether the program aligns with your interests and career goals. Would you like me to tailor the list more to your situation?
