 **What does "no course articulated" mean in the agreements between institutions?**

This is the default setting for when a university course does not have an established articulation with the community college you are viewing. The reason why articulation is not established may vary. Consult your campus counselor or the institution’s ASSIST data manager with specific questions. Contact information for each institution on assist.org can be found on the [ASSIST Resource Center Contact page](https://resource.assist.org/Contact).
