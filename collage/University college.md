Is this answer helpful?
The sources provided do not contain a metric explicitly labeled "transfer percentage" for majors.

However, the tables do provide an "Admit rate" (the percentage of applicants who were admitted) and a "Yield rate" (the percentage of admitted students who enrolled) for various majors. I will provide these two metrics, as they are the closest available percentages related to admission for each major.

Here are the admission and yield rates for the majors you inquired about across the listed universities:

### UC San Diego

Here‚Äôs what I found on **BS‚ÜíMS ‚Äú10‚Äëmonth/1‚Äëyear/5‚Äëyear‚Äù pathways that can cut total cost** at the universities you listed:

---

## üü¶ UCLA

UCLA offers internal accelerated pathways that reduce overall cost:

- For **Computer Science**, there's the **ESAP (Early Specialization Admission Program)**: if you maintain a 3.5 GPA in your undergrad CS studies, you‚Äôre **guaranteed admission** to the MS program and can apply some graduate-level coursework while still completing your BS. This reduces both time and tuition.‚ÄÇ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/18dc0y9?utm_source=chatgpt.com "BS + MS"), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/tmga44?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Funding your MS in CS"))
    
- In **Mathematics**, the **Departmental Scholars Program** allows qualifying undergrads to complete both the bachelor‚Äôs and a master‚Äôs in **four years**‚Äîagain, shaving off time and cost.‚ÄÇ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/18dc0y9?utm_source=chatgpt.com "BS + MS"))
    

---

## üü† USC (University of Southern California)

USC has a form of **Progressive Degree Program (PDP)**‚Äîa 4+1 structure:

- You take some graduate classes during your final undergraduate year. This **shortens total time** and **eliminates the GRE requirement**; some coursework may be billed under undergraduate rates, which helps contain costs.‚ÄÇ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/groucr?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Questions about the master program"))
    
- It seems **most master‚Äôs students at USC don‚Äôt receive tuition waivers**‚ÄîTA/RA opportunities are reserved for PhD students. This means the financial advantage comes mostly from **graduating sooner** rather than from subsidized graduate tuition.‚ÄÇ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/groucr?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Questions about the master program"))
    

---

## üîµ UC San Diego, UC Davis, and UC Irvine

There‚Äôs **no clear evidence** these campuses offer formal BS‚ÜíMS acceleration programs with tuition benefits:

- I couldn‚Äôt find specific **structured combined BS/MS programs** that guarantee cost savings or reduced tuition.
    
- They may allow regular enrollment in master's programs with standard graduate tuition.
    
- Financial aid at UC master‚Äôs level is limited, and TA/RA support is more commonly available at the graduate level‚Äîbut not explicitly linked to accelerated tracks.

### ‚úÖ Recommendation

If minimizing both **time and cost** is your goal:

- **UCLA** stands out with its **ESAP (CS)** and **Departmental Scholars (Math)** programs that let you finish faster and reduce graduate-level tuition exposure.
    
- **USC‚Äôs PDP** offers a shortened timeline, though tuition remains at graduate rates‚Äîthere's no guaranteed waiver.
    
- **UC San Diego, Davis, or Irvine** may still offer standard MS degrees or departmental support, but no advertised combined programs exist that explicitly reduce cost.
    

Would you like to check for similar programs in specific departments (like ECE or Biology) at any of these schools? I can also help verify exact application criteria or deadlines.
 
# question to ask about each university
