Here’s what I found on **BS→MS “10‑month/1‑year/5‑year” pathways that can cut total cost** at the universities you listed:

---

## 🟦 UCLA

UCLA offers internal accelerated pathways that reduce overall cost:

- For **Computer Science**, there's the **ESAP (Early Specialization Admission Program)**: if you maintain a 3.5 GPA in your undergrad CS studies, you’re **guaranteed admission** to the MS program and can apply some graduate-level coursework while still completing your BS. This reduces both time and tuition. ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/18dc0y9?utm_source=chatgpt.com "BS + MS"), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/tmga44?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Funding your MS in CS"))
    
- In **Mathematics**, the **Departmental Scholars Program** allows qualifying undergrads to complete both the bachelor’s and a master’s in **four years**—again, shaving off time and cost. ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/18dc0y9?utm_source=chatgpt.com "BS + MS"))
    

---

## 🟠 USC (University of Southern California)

USC has a form of **Progressive Degree Program (PDP)**—a 4+1 structure:

- You take some graduate classes during your final undergraduate year. This **shortens total time** and **eliminates the GRE requirement**; some coursework may be billed under undergraduate rates, which helps contain costs. ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/groucr?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Questions about the master program"))
    
- It seems **most master’s students at USC don’t receive tuition waivers**—TA/RA opportunities are reserved for PhD students. This means the financial advantage comes mostly from **graduating sooner** rather than from subsidized graduate tuition. ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/groucr?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Questions about the master program"))
    

---

## 🔵 UC San Diego, UC Davis, and UC Irvine

There’s **no clear evidence** these campuses offer formal BS→MS acceleration programs with tuition benefits:

- I couldn’t find specific **structured combined BS/MS programs** that guarantee cost savings or reduced tuition.
    
- They may allow regular enrollment in master's programs with standard graduate tuition.
    
- Financial aid at UC master’s level is limited, and TA/RA support is more commonly available at the graduate level—but not explicitly linked to accelerated tracks.

### ✅ Recommendation

If minimizing both **time and cost** is your goal:

- **UCLA** stands out with its **ESAP (CS)** and **Departmental Scholars (Math)** programs that let you finish faster and reduce graduate-level tuition exposure.
    
- **USC’s PDP** offers a shortened timeline, though tuition remains at graduate rates—there's no guaranteed waiver.
    
- **UC San Diego, Davis, or Irvine** may still offer standard MS degrees or departmental support, but no advertised combined programs exist that explicitly reduce cost.
