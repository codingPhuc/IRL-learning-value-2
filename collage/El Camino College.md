## Contact Council

You need to be a student to make an appointment:

1. Select from the seven Meta Majors below that most closely matches your major, or area of interest.
   _If you are part of a Support or Success Program, go to "Meet with a Program or Department Counselor."_
2. Fill out the request form using your **El Camino College email address**. Most returning students who still have an ID number may not have access to their El Camino email; please contact the Counseling office for more assistance.
3. Appointments can be in person, by phone, or Zoom. To better assist you with scheduling an appointment, you can select more than one appointment format.
4. In addition to selecting multiple appointment formats, we recommend selecting more than one day/time that you can meet with a counselor. There is also a section where you can clarify your availability, such as your school or work schedule.
5. Get ready to plan your informative session! Have your questions ready for the counselor, and copies of transcripts/test scores/placement survey results for review, if applicable.
