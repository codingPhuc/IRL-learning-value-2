## Avoided/Lower-Ranked Colleges

25. **Mission College**
   - **Cons**:
     - Generally not recommended; described as depressing.
26. **Santa Monica College (SMC) - Overrated Aspect**
   - While highly regarded, some believe its "highest transfer rate" statistic is misleading due to its large student body.

## General Tips

- If transferring to a **UC**, prioritize SMC, PCC, or GCC.
- For **CSUs**, any CC will work well, so opt for a cheaper city or closer to family to save on living costs.
- Consider living outside LA to avoid high living expenses, then transfer to a university in LA later.
