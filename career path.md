- actuarial science  

bases on my understanding , the quantitative financial have many different type of role . Some roles require research skill like risk management and analysis .  While other  require programming skill and mathematic skill  like quantitative programming . The flied thought is asking for more and more education so a PHD is necessary  to enter 
the programming skill that a quantitative programmer will have , have a strong tie to data engineering as appose to other programming subskill 
so to get a job you need a bachelor  for programming quant and master or above for other quant flied 


Great summary‚Äîyou're identifying both the appeal and complexity of the quantitative finance field. To explore your interest further and get personalized guidance from someone already in the industry (e.g., a Quant or someone working in computational finance), ask questions that clarify:

### üîç **Your Fit and Interests**

These questions help you determine if your skills, interests, and values align with the job:

- **What do you most enjoy about your work as a quant/researcher/developer?**
    
- **What type of problems do you solve on a daily basis?**
    
- **What part of your job uses the most math or programming?**
    
- **How much of your role is research vs. coding vs. meetings?**
    
- **Did you always know you wanted to work in this field? How did you find your niche?**
    

### üéØ **Skills and Learning Path**

To see if you're on the right track:

- **What programming languages do you use daily, and how deeply do you need to know them?**
    
- **If someone wanted to break into your role today, what skills would they need to demonstrate most?**
    
- **What was your educational background, and how much did your degree help in landing your job?**
    
- **Do you think it's possible to break into quant finance without a PhD? If so, how?**
    

### üß† **Career Reality Check**

To ground your expectations:

- **What are the most misunderstood aspects of being a quant?**
    
- **How stressful is your job, especially during market crashes or high-volatility periods?**
    
- **How competitive is your company/team in hiring new people?**
    
- **Can someone start in a non-quant finance role and transition into quant?**
    

### üß≠ **Exploring Options**

To see where you might fit:

- **What‚Äôs the difference between a quant researcher, a quant trader, and a quant developer?**
    
- **Which path is best if I prefer math over finance‚Äîor vice versa?**
    
- **What resources would you recommend (books, courses, projects) to someone trying to get their foot in the door?**
    

Would you like a condensed version of these questions formatted for email or informational interviews?


#### 2. **Machine Learning Engineer / Research Scientist**

- **Why?**
    
    - Intellectually challenging, low interaction, high autonomy.
        
    - High income potential and job growth.
        
    - Opportunity to work on things like surveillance, prediction, and personal data modeling.
        
- **Skills to develop**: Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, math foundations (linear algebra, optimization), deep learning, NLP.
    
if  I go  into this flied I would like to go into computer vision 

my understanding of this flied  is that you there  is a hierarchy of data from the top to bottom . Machine learning implementation is on the top using the data , while operation like getting the data and all of that is base on data engineering work and do not need qualification to work in .  

I like computer vision because I can implement model on real life low end vehicle  like car . I also hope that it translate to real world  system like embedded system  


I require a lot of linear algebra  as oppose to other flied in the work  

1. Acquire necessary data (scraping, processing into useful format storing somewhere accessible i.e. cloud storage or local hard drive) python, requests, pandas, google cloud storage.
    
2. Prepare training dataset (feature engineering, usually process into csv) python pandas, sometimes random external libraries sometimes in other languages.
    
3. Design initial model architecture, get training to actually work usually involves a lot of debugging. All in jupyter notebook using pytorch, local if possible else on gcp
    
4. Evaluate model, loss + accuracy good to confirm model is learning and sanity check but mostly this involves using the eye test in a real world scenario so build poc product integration at this stage (usually python web api and some frontend for interacting either python desktop app or js web app just running locally)
    
5. Iterate 3 + 4 until model is good enough for prod.
    
6. Implement prod deployment usually python web api often get frontend specialist involved at this point to handle any potential frontend integrations.
    
7. Maintain prod integration as bugs come up and new features are requested. Also continously eval model performance (depends on domain).
    
8. Come back a year later and work through the whole process again adding incremental improvements to each step.


## my advantage 
- the competition to get into this flied is very large and  oversaturated  
- for this I need a purse computer science degree  , I already done the basic in Vietnam and can already understand some basic algorithm 
- I already know how to program simple data module in python  
- I already know how to program in C/C++ for simple application 
- though since I lack work experience , I don't know the best practice and so on 



### üîç **Your Fit and Interests**

- **How often do you work on real-world product integration vs. just models?**
    
- **How much time do you spend coding vs. experimenting vs. debugging?**
    
- **What attracted you to computer vision in particular, and how has it evolved for you?**
    

### üéØ **Skills and Learning Path**

To gauge if you're progressing in the right direction:

- **How did you learn best practices for model training and deployment?**
    
- **What was the most important project you did that helped you land your first ML role?**
    
- **If someone already knows basic Python and C++, how should they go deeper into ML and computer vision?**
    
- **What tools or libraries are essential in your day-to-day work?**
    

### üß† **Career Reality Check**

To understand challenges in the field:

- **Is it true that the ML field is oversaturated? How do you stand out when applying?**
    
- **How do employers evaluate ML candidates who don‚Äôt have much work experience?**
    
- **What are common misconceptions beginners have about ML careers?**
    
- **Do most people in your field have graduate degrees, or are self-taught candidates common too?**
    

### üß≠ **Exploring Options**

To learn about role variations and future directions:

- **What‚Äôs the difference between a research scientist, ML engineer, and data scientist in your company?**
    
- **Do you work closely with embedded systems or robotics teams?**
    
- **What are emerging areas in computer vision that excite you?**
    
- **What‚Äôs the best way to build a portfolio that‚Äôs attractive to ML recruiters or hiring managers?**
#### 3. **Cybersecurity / Ethical Hacking (Red Team / Reverse Engineering)**

- **Why?**
    
    - Appeals to your curiosity about hidden information and systems.
        
    - High demand, good pay, low interaction.
        
    - Can work in government, defense, or freelance.

- **Do you recommend certifications like OSCP, or are personal projects more valuable?**
    

### üß† **Career Reality Check**

To keep your expectations realistic:

- **How competitive is the cryptography subfield compared to general pen testing?**
    
- **Can someone enter this field without a computer science degree?**
    
- **What‚Äôs the biggest challenge you faced early in your career?**
    
- **How often do you encounter new vulnerabilities, and how do you stay up to date?**
    

### üß≠ **Exploring Options**
