International student tuition for the 2024-2025 academic year is **$485 USD per unit**.  
The best bet is that you took 2 courses.

The most optimal is taking ENGR 101 AND 102 for transferring [ENGR Courses](https://catalog.cccd.edu/golden-west/course-descriptions/credit-courses/engr/), which means that I have 10 units left. So that leaves me with 3,3,4 or 4,4,3.

For 3 there are:
- Java Programming 1
- C++ Programming 1
- Python Programming I

Math Calculus 1:
**MATH G180** 4 Units (72 lecture hours)  
**Calculus 1**  
**Prerequisite(s):** [MATH G170](https://catalog.cccd.edu/search/?P=MATH%20G170) 4 units or [MATH G115](https://catalog.cccd.edu/search/?P=MATH%20G115) 4 units and [MATH G120](https://catalog.cccd.edu/search/?P=MATH%20G120) 3 units or appropriate Math Placement.

The most important thing is only taking 12 units at most due to the cost of attending Golden West then transferring to California Long Beach.  
So I either take the math courses 3, 4, 4 for the beginning then transfer to another college or something else?

BIOL 200 General Biology:  
**BIOL G100** 4 Units (54 lecture hours; 54 lab hours)

## Transfer Guide
what is the the deadlines for completing admission criteria  
- For **fall semester admission**, coursework and unit minimums must be completed no later than **the prior spring term.**
- For **spring semester admission**, coursework and unit minimums must be completed no later than **the prior summer term.**

Please understand that we are obliged to confirm that you have met all admission criteria based on a review of your **official** academic record. We find that if the applicant is completing admission requirements in **the term immediately preceding** their first semester at CSU Long Beach that it is usually **not possible** for a student to submit a final official college transcript in time to enroll at CSULB. Please work with your transfer counselors to complete all critical admission criteria, including unit minimums and course work, by the time you submit your application to CSULB.

[Transfer Students](https://www.csulb.edu/student-affairs/university-outreach-school-relations/transfer-students)

Also to consider there are highly impacted majors requirement from California State Long Beach, meaning if the major you apply for is highly competitive you should expect an increase in administration criteria. Supplemental criteria may include interviews, auditions, portfolios, or other academic credentials.

CSULB at the end of each semester sets up in front of the bookstore to buy your book. You can also try on Chegg, Craigslist, even OfferUp! You never know where someone searches for their books!

u/clearshoe  
I got $30 for a $200 book and $0.25 for a $60 book. I highly recommend you try selling your books directly to other students first!
