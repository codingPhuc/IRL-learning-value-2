## thread for  information at USC  

[discussing  thread link](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/soh9e6/transferring_to_usc_tips/)
- **Higher Acceptance Rate for Transfers** – USC’s transfer acceptance rate (24%) is significantly higher than for freshmen (11%), making it an easier entry route. The average transfer GPA is lower than the freshman average.
    
- **Community College (CC) as a Smart Option** – Many students start at a CC, maintain a high GPA (close to 4.0), get involved in extracurriculars, and then transfer. USC accepts a large number of CC transfers, particularly from schools like Santa Monica College.
    
- **Application Strategy** – Strong essays, involvement in extracurriculars, and high academic performance are key to standing out. SAT/ACT scores are not required unless they significantly strengthen an application.
    
- **Cost Considerations** – Attending CC first saves a significant amount of money on tuition, especially for students from lower-income backgrounds. However, USC’s tuition is still high, so scholarships and financial aid may be necessary.
    
- **GPA & Credits** – A GPA of 3.7+ is recommended. Many students with dual enrollment or AP credits wonder how they will be classified (sophomore or junior transfer).
    
- **Major Considerations** – Some programs, like UCLA’s ASN to BSN, are highly competitive. USC’s communication program has accepted students with less than a 4.0 GPA.
    
- **Sophomore vs. Junior Transfers** – No clear preference by USC, but transfer applicants should complete their General Education (GE) requirements.
    
- **Final Takeaway** – Transferring to USC is achievable with dedication, strong academics, and a well-crafted application. Many students have successfully transferred and find USC worth the effort.



[discussion  thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/1boubuo/things_i_wish_i_knew_before_coming_to_usc_as_a/) 
It looks like you're trying to get a general sentiment on USC graduate programs, particularly around job opportunities, networking, costs, and the overall value of a master's degree from USC.

The key takeaways from the discussion:

- **On-campus jobs**: Hard to come by for graduate students, mostly reserved for undergrads.
- **Career support**: Limited; networking and personal effort are crucial for finding jobs.
- **Housing**: Expensive, with safety concerns around the area. Free Lyft is available.
- **Orientation**: More of a social event than an informative one.
- **Graduate program reputation**: Many feel it's a "cash cow" with little ROI compared to the undergrad prestige.
- **Job market**: Tough, especially for roles in data science, finance, and economics.

Are you considering USC for a graduate program, or are you weighing your options between multiple universities?



[discussion  thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/1br0gb2/is_usc_better_in_undergrad_or_grad_programs/) 
The discussion revolves around the reputation of USC's undergraduate and graduate programs. Key takeaways include:

- **Undergraduate Reputation**: USC’s undergrad program has improved significantly over the past 30 years, rising from a lower-tier school to a highly competitive one, though still often ranked below UCLA.
- **Graduate Programs**: Some USC grad programs, like the **Gould Law School**, **Marshall MBA**, and **Viterbi Engineering**, are well-regarded, though often slightly behind UCLA. **Marshall MBA** has recently surpassed UCLA Anderson in rankings, but some believe this is due to strategic admissions policies rather than academic superiority.
- **Masters Programs**: Many non-thesis master’s programs are seen as “cash cows,” with easy admissions and weaker job placement compared to undergrad. The **MSCS program** has a poor reputation, mainly attracting international students for visa purposes.
- **PhD Programs**: Generally better supported, with students forming closer ties with faculty and departments.
- **USC Price School**: Solid but expensive, and not highly selective.
- **Keck School of Medicine**: Well-regarded.
- **Doctor of Physical Therapy**: Ranked #1 in the country.

Overall, USC has strong programs but some master's degrees are perceived as money-driven with weaker job prospects.
