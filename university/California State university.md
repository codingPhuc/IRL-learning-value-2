## Interested Program
The electrical engineering program offers instruction in the basic sciences and in engineering analysis and design. The upper-division offerings provide a flexible, broad curriculum to enable each student to match talents and interests with career objectives. The major areas of course concentrations are biomedical, circuits, communications, computers, controls, electronics, and power.

The BS degree in Electrical Engineering is accredited by the [Engineering Accreditation Commission](https://www.abet.org/) of ABET, [https://www.abet.org](https://www.abet.org/), under the commissionâ€™s General Criteria and Program Criteria for Electrical, Computer, Communications, Telecommunications(s), and Similarly Named Engineering Programs. All accredited programs are required to provide the following minimum level of instruction: one year of mathematics and basic sciences; one and one-half years of engineering science and design (engineering topics); and one-half year of humanities and social sciences.

The total number of units required for the Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering is 122, of which 104 units are in the major. A total of 48 units of general education courses are required for the degree. Students in the electrical engineering program will complete 30 in the major. Consult with an advisor for the specific number of units required in all areas of the degree including GE and free electives.

## Tuition Fee
- **12 units per semester**: **$739.59** per unit.
- **15 units per semester**: **$670.87** per unit.

The lower division bases on the transfer rate of [[El Camino College#Tuition Fee]], so the cost of California State University is:
- **$26,000** if 12 units for the lower division cost.
- **$24,000** if 15 units per semester.

But if taking the [[El Camino College]] transfer route, it will only be...

## If Transfer
I will receive a baseline of $40,870 for other courses that will be transferred.

### Cases
#### Take Only the Required Units
If I spend only ($15,870, $16,790) based on the [[El Camino College#Tuition Fee]] then combined with the other units in California State University, it will be a total of ($56,740, $57,660).

#### Take More Than the Required Units
If I spend only ($20,178, $21,535) based on the [[El Camino College#Tuition Fee]] then combined with the other units in California State University, it will be a total of ($61,048, $62,448).

$24,960 if I were to work for a full year for 3 days each week. This is not counting taxes.  
If I put aside about $10,000 of work for tuition, then for 4 years the cost will be $16,740.  
There is also the case of auditing 6 other upper units like:
- [EE 3000 - Economics for Engineers (also listed as CE 3000, ME 3000)](https://ecatalog.calstatela.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=54&poid=25492&returnto=8415) [3]
- [ENGR 3010 - Ethics and Professionalism in Engineering](https://ecatalog.calstatela.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=54&poid=25492&returnto=8415) [3]  
Will look into it for a 6 unit reduction.
