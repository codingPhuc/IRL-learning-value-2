This Reddit thread from 10 years ago is a great little time capsule of textbook advice from students in the trenches. Here's a quick summary of the key takeaways and a few extra thoughts if you're deciding whether to buy new, used, or rent:

### ðŸ”‘ **Common Advice from the Thread**

- **Avoid buying new** unless:
    
    - You want a pristine copy for long-term reference.
        
    - It comes with a required access code or software (sometimes cheaper bundled).
        
- **Used books** are the go-to for most:
    
    - Way cheaper.
        
    - Highlighting and notes rarely interfere with learning.
        
    - Just double-check ISBNs.
        
- **Renting** is highly popular:
    
    - Sites like Chegg, Amazon, or Half.com (back then!) often had great deals.
        
    - Saves money for classes where you donâ€™t need to keep the book.
        
- **Online comparison is key**:
    
    - Bookfinder4u, ThriftBooks, or simply shopping around online can save serious cash.
        
    - Avoid school bookstores unless youâ€™re in a pinch.
        
- **Access codes** are tricky:
    
    - If your class _requires_ one, you may need to buy new or buy the code separately.
        
    - Sometimes used books + separate code is still cheaper.

### ðŸ§  Bonus Thoughts (2025 edition):

- **Digital copies** and **open textbooks** have come a long way since 2015â€”always check if your course supports those.
    
- **Library reserves** can be a lifesaver. Many colleges let you borrow textbooks for short periods (like 2-3 hours).
    
- **PDFs & scanned copies** float around online, but legality and quality varyâ€”use with discretion.
    
- **Watch out for custom editions** made by professorsâ€”these often canâ€™t be found used.
