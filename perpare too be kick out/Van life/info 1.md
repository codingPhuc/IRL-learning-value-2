The location should be near a collage ?
He live in a van 
u/RTMalthus
Yeah. If you can swing it, the most “stealth” (not fun) option these days is actually a minivan, not a transit van, compact van, or truck camper. Just black out all the windows (they rarely ticket for this in SoCal), get a small solar panel and a small circular 6” vent in the roof. Not as comfortable as a transit van, but if you’ll be at school / library / gym most of the time, it’ll just be a place to sleep, read, etc. Can also keep a small cassette toilet, yeti cooler, tiny stove, bolt down safe for laptop. Add a gps tracker if you wish. San Diego is one of the few places in the US where you can get away without climate control most of the year, and I assume you’ll be able to head out of the city in the hot summertime.
There are some pretty impressive builds on YouTube. It’s by no means sexy, but because it’s a friggin mini van / soccer van, no one will question it. Even better if you have some “ . . . HS soccer” stickers on the back.
Biggest risk with transit vans in California these days isn’t HOAs or Karens, it’s actually thieves. They’ve seen the YouTube videos of people keeping MacBook pros, PS5s, recoding equipment, ebikes, surfboards in their transit vans. Any transit van parked in a California neighborhood or a parking lot overnight, and people are gonna assume someone is inside. A clean but boring soccer van is a lot less interesting.
If you can afford it, I’d also get a really small storage unit to keep extra clothes, hard drives, sporting equipment, suits, books, etc. Further you get away from the city, the cheaper they get.
The second most stealth option is probably getting a compact transit van (NV200, pro master city, etc.), but make it look like a work van. Maybe a delivery (flowers?) van of some sort so thieves won’t assume there are tools inside. Don’t make it look like an electrician’s van or medical supply delivery. One guy I met made a logo for bait delivery (squid, anchovies, sardines, etc.) and always parked near the coast. Even had a fake company website, etc. No thief wants to steal a bunch of frozen chum.
Transit vans are great for traditional vanlife / outdoor rec, but they’re not discrete in the state of California for stealth camping. You have to assume people know you’re inside at night, and thieves know there are valuable possessions left inside all day. If you’re a student, you’ll be leaving your van unattended for long periods at a time, and this will be noticeable.
When friends of mine vanlife in SoCal or NorCal, they either have one person stay in the van or they aren’t away for the for more than 15 min.
In SF, you can’t leave your van unattended for 30 seconds in some neighborhoods.
Good luck

How does applying work ?
What major should i take ?
The US government does not understand how to deal with people that do not have a permanent residence. As an international student, being without a residential address will cause problems with the university, insurers, the DMV, banks, the IRS, etc. Most van lifers have a former address and friends/family that they can use along with knowledge about how the US systems work. While it will be more difficult, you could overcome all of these issues.
You will run into a likely insurmountable issue if you need to extend or modify your visa. Fudging an address on forms for the DMV or bank is one thing. Fudging things on immigration forms is a sure way to get deported.
