# Who is consider "exempt individual"

If you're in one of these categories, **your days in the U.S. may not count**:

1. **Foreign government-related individuals** (like diplomats)
    
2. **Teachers or trainees** (on J or Q visas)
    
3. **Students** (on F, J, M, or Q visas)
    
4. **Professional athletes** (temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable event)


# Substantial Presence Test. 
The Substantial Presence Test is one of the ways an individual can be classified as a **resident alien for U.S. tax purposes**.

Here's a comprehensive overview of the Substantial Presence Test:

**1. Purpose of the Test** The Substantial Presence Test helps determine your residency status for U.S. tax purposes. If you meet this test, you are considered a resident alien, and generally taxed on your **worldwide income**, similar to U.S. citizens. If you do not meet this test, you are generally considered a nonresident alien.

**2. How to Meet the Test (for Calendar Year 2024)** To meet the Substantial Presence Test for calendar year 2024, you must be physically present in the United States on at least:

- **31 days during 2024**.
- **183 days during the 3-year period** that includes 2024, 2023, and 2022, calculated by counting:
    - **All the days** you were present in 2024.
    - **1/3 of the days** you were present in 2023.
    - **1/6 of the days** you were present in 2022.

**Example:** If you were physically present in the U.S. for 120 days in 2024, 120 days in 2023, and 120 days in 2022, your total for the 3-year period would be 120 (for 2024) + 40 (1/3 of 120 for 2023) + 20 (1/6 of 120 for 2022) = 180 days. In this example, you would **not** be considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2024 because the total is less than 183 days.

**3. Definition of "United States" for the Test** The term "United States" for this test includes:

- All 50 states and the District of Columbia.
- The territorial waters of the United States.
- The seabed and subsoil of adjacent submarine areas over which the U.S. has exclusive rights to explore and exploit natural resources under international law.
- **It does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace**.

**4. Days of Presence in the United States (Exclusions)** Generally, you are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country at any time during the day. However, there are **exceptions** for days that **do not count** for the substantial presence test:

- **Regular Commuters from Canada or Mexico:** Days you commute to work from a residence in Canada or Mexico are not counted if you regularly commute (more than 75% of workdays in your working period).
- **Days in Transit:** Days you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours while in transit between two places outside the U.S. are not counted. This applies if your activities are substantially related to completing foreign travel, but not if you conduct business meetings.
- **Crew Members:** Days you are temporarily present as a regular crew member of a foreign vessel engaged in transportation between the U.S. and a foreign country or U.S. territory, unless you engage in other U.S. trade or business activities on those days.
- **Medical Condition:** Days you intended to leave the U.S. but could not due to a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S.. You cannot exclude days if you were able to leave but remained beyond a reasonable period, or if you returned for treatment of a pre-existing condition. If you exclude days due to a medical condition, you **must file Form 8843**.
- **Exempt Individuals:** Days for which you are an "exempt individual" are not counted. The term "exempt individual" **does not mean exempt from U.S. tax**, but rather refers to individuals whose days of presence do not count for the substantial presence test. These categories include:
    - **Foreign Government-Related Individuals:** Individuals (and their immediate family members whose visa status is derived from theirs) temporarily present under "A" or "G" visas (excluding A-3 or G-5 visa holders who are household staff) due to diplomatic status or as full-time employees of an international organization.
    - **Teachers or Trainees:** Individuals temporarily present under "J" or "Q" visas who substantially comply with visa requirements. There are limitations on how many of the preceding 6 calendar years you can be exempt (generally not more than 2 years, with an exception if a foreign employer paid all compensation). Immediate family members are also included. If you qualify, you **must file Form 8843**.
    - **Students:** Individuals temporarily present under "F," "J," "M," or "Q" visas who substantially comply with visa requirements. You are generally not exempt if you have been exempt as a teacher, trainee, or student for any part of more than 5 calendar years, unless you establish no intent to reside permanently in the U.S. and comply with visa requirements. Immediate family members are also included. If you qualify, you **must file Form 8843**.
    - **Professional Athletes:** Individuals temporarily present to compete in a charitable sports event. Only days of actual competition are excluded. If you qualify, you **must file Form 8843**.

**Form 8843:** If you exclude days of presence due to a medical condition, as a teacher/trainee, as a student, or as a professional athlete, you **must file a fully completed Form 8843**. This form must be attached to your income tax return or sent to the IRS address in Austin, TX, by the due date for filing Form 1040-NR. Failure to timely file Form 8843 can result in the loss of the ability to exclude these days, unless you can show reasonable actions and significant steps to comply.

**5. Closer Connection to a Foreign Country Exception** Even if you meet the Substantial Presence Test, you can still be treated as a nonresident alien if you meet all of the following conditions:

- You are present in the United States for **less than 183 days during the current year**.
    
- You **maintain a tax home in a foreign country** during the year.
    
- You have a **closer connection** during the year to one foreign country (or two foreign countries under specific conditions) in which you have a tax home than to the United States.
    
- **Tax Home:** Your tax home is generally the main place of your business, employment, or post of duty. If you don't have a regular place of business, it's where you regularly live. If neither applies, you are an itinerant, and your tax home is wherever you work. For this exception, your tax home must exist for the entire current year and be in the foreign country to which you claim a closer connection.
    
- **Establishing a Closer Connection:** You are considered to have a closer connection to a foreign country if you maintain more significant contacts with that country than with the U.S. Factors considered include your country of residence on documents, location of permanent home, family, personal belongings, social/political/cultural/professional/religious affiliations, business activities, driver's license jurisdiction, voting jurisdiction, and charitable contributions.
    
- **When You Cannot Have a Closer Connection:** You cannot claim a closer connection if you applied for or took steps to change your status to a permanent resident during the year, or if you had an application pending for adjustment of status.
    
- **Form 8840:** You **must attach a fully completed Form 8840** to your income tax return to claim a closer connection to a foreign country. If you don't have to file a return, send it to the IRS address in Austin, TX, by the Form 1040-NR due date. Failure to timely file Form 8840 can result in the loss of this claim, unless you show reasonable actions and significant steps to comply.
    

**6. Effect on Residency Starting Date** If you meet the substantial presence test for a calendar year, your **residency starting date** is generally the first day you are present in the United States during that calendar year. However, you **do not have to count up to 10 days of actual presence** if on those days you establish that you had a closer connection and tax home in a foreign country. This exclusion of up to 10 days for determining the starting date is **different from the count for meeting the substantial presence test itself**, where those days _are_ included.

- A **statement** must be filed with the IRS to exclude up to 10 days of presence for residency starting date purposes. This statement needs specific personal and factual information. It must be submitted on or before the due date for filing Form 1040-NR.

The Substantial Presence Test is a key component in determining your U.S. tax residency, which in turn dictates how your income is taxed by the United States. 




# dividen income 

Dividend income, for U.S. tax purposes, refers to income received from investments in corporations. The taxation of this income depends significantly on whether the individual receiving it is classified as a U.S. resident alien or a nonresident alien, and on the source of the dividend.

Here's a breakdown of what constitutes dividend income and its tax implications:

- **General Definition and Source**
    
    - In most cases, **dividend income received from domestic corporations is considered U.S. source income**.
    - Dividend income from foreign corporations is typically foreign source income.
    - A substitute dividend payment, such as one made in a securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction, is sourced in the same way as a distribution on the transferred security.
- **Exceptions to Foreign Corporation Dividend Sourcing**
    
    - A portion of dividends received from a foreign corporation can be treated as U.S. source income if 25% or more of that corporation's total gross income for a three-year period (or since its formation if less than three years) before the dividend declaration was effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. The U.S. source portion is determined by multiplying the dividend by a fraction: (Foreign corporation's gross income connected with a U.S. trade or business for the 3-year period) / (Foreign corporation's gross income from all sources for that period).
- **Dividend Equivalent Payments**
    
    - U.S. source dividends also include **dividend equivalent payments**. These can be:
        - Substitute dividends paid through securities lending, sale-repurchase, or similar transactions.
        - Payments that refer to a U.S. source dividend made under a specified notional principal contract (NPC) or a specified equity-linked instrument (ELI).
    - An NPC or ELI is generally considered "specified" if it is a delta one transaction. The amount of a dividend equivalent for such contracts is typically the per-share dividend amount multiplied by the number of shares referenced and by the contract's delta. These payments are treated as received even if there's a net payment from the taxpayer or if the net amount is zero.
- **Taxation for Resident Aliens**
    
    - **Resident aliens are generally taxed on their worldwide income, including dividend income, in the same manner as U.S. citizens**. They must report all interest, dividends, wages, and other income regardless of its source.
    - Resident aliens' income is subject to the **graduated tax rates** that apply to U.S. citizens.
- **Taxation for Nonresident Aliens**
    
    - Nonresident aliens are typically taxed only on their U.S. source income and certain income connected with a U.S. trade or business.
    - For nonresident aliens, **dividends are generally taxed at a flat 30% rate**, or a lower treaty rate if applicable, if they are _not_ effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. The payer, such as a brokerage company, should withhold this tax at the source.
    - If dividends _are_ effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, they are taxed at the graduated rates that apply to U.S. citizens and residents, after allowable deductions.
    - **Certain dividends are exempt from the 30% tax for nonresident aliens**:
        - Some dividends paid by foreign corporations are exempt, though this exemption does not apply to dividend equivalent payments.
        - **Interest-related dividends** from U.S. mutual funds or regulated investment companies (RICs) are exempt from the 30% tax if designated in writing by the mutual fund.
        - **Certain short-term capital gain dividends** from U.S. mutual funds or RICs are exempt from the 30% tax if designated in writing by the mutual fund, but this specific tax relief _does not apply_ if the nonresident alien is present in the United States for 183 days or more during their tax year.
- **Reporting Requirements**
    
    - If the correct tax is not withheld on dividends, a nonresident alien must file Form 1040-NR to receive a refund or pay any additional tax due.
    - For dual-status aliens, income from U.S. sources, including dividends, is taxable whether received as a nonresident or resident alien, unless specifically exempt by law or treaty.Dividend income, for U.S. tax purposes, refers to income received from investments in corporations. The taxation of this income depends significantly on whether the individual receiving it is classified as a U.S. resident alien or a nonresident alien, and on the source of the dividend.

## Tax on scholarships  


> [!PDF|234, 82, 82] [[p519.pdf#page=136&annotation=5483R|p519, p.136]]
> > Withholding on Scholarships and Fellowship Grants

**Withholding** means that the **payer (like a university or government agency)** takes a portion of your **scholarship or grant** and **sends it directly to the IRS as a prepayment of tax** on your behalf. 


> **Withholding** means that the **payer (like a university or government agency)** takes a portion of your **scholarship or grant** and **sends it directly to the IRS as a prepayment of tax** on your behalf.

It **does not mean** that you're automatically exempt from paying tax.

---

### üîç Example:

Suppose you‚Äôre a **nonresident alien student** on an **F-1 visa** and receive a **U.S. scholarship** of **$10,000**. Here's what could happen:

#### Case 1: Part of it is taxable (and not exempt by treaty)

- Let‚Äôs say **$4,000** is for **room & board**, which is taxable.
    
- The **withholding rate is 14%**, so the university withholds:
    

0.14√ó4000=$5600.14 \times 4000 = \$560

- So, **you receive $9,440**, and **$560 is sent to the IRS**.
    

> You may still **file a tax return later (Form 1040-NR)** to possibly get some of that back ‚Äî depending on your full tax situation.

- **Yes**, they **withhold** (hold back) **14% or 30% of the taxable amount** and **send it to the IRS**.
    
- This is **not a penalty**, it's a **prepayment** of your taxes.
    
- It **does not necessarily mean** you‚Äôre done paying taxes ‚Äî you still may need to **file a return** at year-end.
    

### üßæ Summary of Rates:

|Situation|Withholding Rate|
|---|---|
|Degree-seeking student, taxable part of scholarship, no services|**14%** (or lower with tax treaty)|
|Not a degree candidate|**30%**|
|Scholarship **for services** (like TA/RA work)|**Subject to wage tax rates** (graduated withholding)|
