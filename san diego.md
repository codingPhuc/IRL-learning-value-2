## best engineering degree at ucsd

Choosing the best engineering degree at UCSD can be a daunting task, but here's a guide based on the experiences and opinions of various Redditors to help you make an informed decision.

### General Advice

- **Follow Your Interests**: Many Redditors emphasize the importance of choosing a major you are genuinely interested in rather than one that seems the easiest or most lucrative.¬†["Don‚Äôt apply to a major that you aren‚Äôt interested in."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/12rf37o/comment/jgvdt9a/)
- **Consider Job Security and Potential**: Some majors are seen as more stable and versatile than others.¬†["As an SE major, we always have job security (constant need for housing, building, transportation infrastructure etc. + maintenance)."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1gn4s53/comment/lw7w9rs/)

### Specific Engineering Majors at UCSD

#### Electrical Engineering (EE)

- **Pros**: High demand in San Diego's tech scene, good pay, less competitive than CS.¬†["Especially in San Diego, get into analog/digital/VLSI stuff and you have job opportunities at NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Apple, and the metric shit ton of other companies in the same field here."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1gn4s53/comment/lw7ugn1/)
- **Cons**: Can be challenging.¬†["Pretty good pay but also harder."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1gn4s53/comment/lw7ugn1/)

#### Mechanical Engineering (ME)

- **Pros**: Broad career options, good balance of theoretical and practical learning.¬†["The program at UCSD in my opinion is very strong and well respected."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1ccnbvy/comment/l1lru2c/)
- **Cons**: Requires active seeking of hands-on experience.¬†["Not that much hands on, but just make sure to join an engineering club to get that experience."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1ccnbvy/comment/l17r3bw/)

#### Structural Engineering (SE)

- **Pros**: High job security, non-impacted major.¬†["Structural engineering and nanoengineering are both non-impacted majors, which makes them the easiest by quite a bit."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/12rf37o/comment/ldqpljh/)
- **Cons**: May be seen as niche compared to other engineering fields.¬†["We have structural which is the more technical side of each specialization of civil, the only specialization you would have a significant disadvantage in is water."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/16oryp2/comment/k1mpvjr/)

#### Nanoengineering

- **Pros**: Good career prospects, non-impacted major.¬†["I am rather biased, but nanoengineering is a great major."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1gn4s53/comment/lwac2nt/)
- **Cons**: Less well-known, potentially limited immediate job opportunities.

#### Aerospace Engineering

- **Pros**: Exciting field, good for those passionate about space and aviation.¬†["UCSD is one of the best places to become an engineer, BUT you have to be active about looking for hands on experience because classes simply won‚Äôt fulfill that aspect for you."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/1ccnbvy/comment/l171pcg/)
- **Cons**: Niche field, may require additional degrees for better job prospects.

### College Rankings for Engineering at UCSD

- **Warren College**: Easiest GEs, good for engineering students.¬†["Im Aerospace, go Warren, the GEs are so easy."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/y96hb3/comment/it4g9c7/)
- **Sixth College**: Good balance of easy GEs, location, and housing.¬†["Sixth has by far the easier GEs, good location and housing."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/17vxice/comment/k9dytsg/)
- **Seventh and Eighth Colleges**: Good GEs and dorms but further from central campus.¬†["Seventh and Eighth have pretty good GEs if you‚Äôre coming in with lots of AP credit, and have very good dorms."](https://www.reddit.com/r/UCSD/comments/17vxice/comment/k9dytsg/)
